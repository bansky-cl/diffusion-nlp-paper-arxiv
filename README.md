|**2025-04-28**|**Multimodal Conditioned Diffusive Time Series Forecasting**|cs.CL|Diffusion models achieve remarkable success in processing images and text, and have been extended to special domains such as time series forecasting (TSF). Existing diffusion-based approaches for TSF primarily focus on modeling single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the rich multimodal information in time series data. To effectively leverage such information for prediction, we propose a multimodal conditioned diffusion model for TSF, namely, MCD-TSF, to jointly utilize timestamps and texts as extra guidance for time series modeling, especially for forecasting. Specifically, Timestamps are combined with time series to establish temporal and semantic correlations among different data points when aggregating information along the temporal dimension. Texts serve as supplementary descriptions of time series' history, and adaptively aligned with data points as well as dynamically controlled in a classifier-free manner. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed MCD-TSF model achieves state-of-the-art performance. |[2504.19669v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19669v1)|null|
|**2025-04-23**|**Planning with Diffusion Models for Target-Oriented Dialogue Systems**|cs.CL|Target-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) remains a significant challenge in the LLM era, where strategic dialogue planning is crucial for directing conversations toward specific targets. However, existing dialogue planning methods generate dialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from compounding errors and myopic actions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages diffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning. DiffTOD formulates dialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance, and leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the dialogue trajectory. To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD introduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types, offering flexible guidance towards diverse TOD targets at test time. Extensive experiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively perform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a long horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong flexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios. Our code and data are accessible through https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DiffTOD. |[2504.16858v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16858v1)|null|
|**2025-04-16**|**d1: Scaling Reasoning in Diffusion Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning**|cs.CL, cs.LG|Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities that benefits from online reinforcement learning (RL). These capabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right autoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive paradigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although recent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive language modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains unclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this end, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into reasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL. Specifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in pretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge and instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b) we introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called diffu-GRPO. Through empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different post-training recipes on multiple mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks. We find that d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a state-of-the-art dLLM. |[2504.12216v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12216v1)|null|
|**2025-04-09**|**A Graph Diffusion Algorithm for Lexical Similarity Evaluation**|cs.CL, 2020: 00A69, 05C90, 91F20|In this paper, we present an algorithm for evaluating lexical similarity between a given language and several reference language clusters. As an input, we have a list of concepts and the corresponding translations in all considered languages. Moreover, each reference language is assigned to one of $c$ language clusters. For each of the concepts, the algorithm computes the distance between each pair of translations. Based on these distances, it constructs a weighted directed graph, where every vertex represents a language. After, it solves a graph diffusion equation with a Dirichlet boundary condition, where the unknown is a map from the vertex set to $\mathbb{R}^c$. The resulting coordinates are values from the interval $[0,1]$ and they can be interpreted as probabilities of belonging to each of the clusters or as a lexical similarity distribution with respect to the reference clusters. The distances between translations are calculated using phonetic transcriptions and a modification of the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. The algorithm can be useful in analyzing relationships between languages spoken in multilingual territories with a lot of mutual influences. We demonstrate this by presenting a case study regarding various European languages. |[2504.06816v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06816v1)|null|
|**2025-04-06**|**DDPT: Diffusion-Driven Prompt Tuning for Large Language Model Code Generation**|cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG|Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation. However, the quality of the generated code is heavily dependent on the structure and composition of the prompts used. Crafting high-quality prompts is a challenging task that requires significant knowledge and skills of prompt engineering. To advance the automation support for the prompt engineering for LLM-based code generation, we propose a novel solution Diffusion-Driven Prompt Tuning (DDPT) that learns how to generate optimal prompt embedding from Gaussian Noise to automate the prompt engineering for code generation. We evaluate the feasibility of diffusion-based optimization and abstract the optimal prompt embedding as a directional vector toward the optimal embedding. We use the code generation loss given by the LLMs to help the diffusion model capture the distribution of optimal prompt embedding during training. The trained diffusion model can build a path from the noise distribution to the optimal distribution at the sampling phrase, the evaluation result demonstrates that DDPT helps improve the prompt optimization for code generation. |[2504.04351v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04351v1)|null|
|**2025-03-16**|**State Fourier Diffusion Language Model (SFDLM): A Scalable, Novel Iterative Approach to Language Modeling**|cs.LG, cs.CL|In recent years, diffusion based methods have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling. Although discrete diffusion for natural language processing has been explored to a lesser extent, it shows promise for tasks requiring iterative denoising of token based data. In standard approaches to text generation, transformers dominate, but their reliance on self attention often incurs high computational costs. This paper introduces a fully diffusion driven discrete text generation model built without any transformer or large convolution modules. Instead, the model integrates structured state space dynamics in the time domain with a novel Complex Fourier Multi Layer Perceptron module that operates in the frequency domain. The forward noising process randomly samples the vocabulary to replace tokens with a controlled probability, while the learned reverse model systematically reverts corrupted sequences toward their original states. By composing local state space updates with global Fourier based mixing, the approach effectively captures both short and long range dependencies. |[2503.17382v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17382v1)|null|
|**2025-03-11**|**Understanding the Quality-Diversity Trade-off in Diffusion Language Models**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG|Diffusion models have seen immense success in modelling continuous data across a range of domains such as vision and audio. Despite the challenges of adapting diffusion models to discrete data, recent work explores their application to text generation by working in the continuous embedding space. However, these models lack a natural means to control the inherent trade-off between quality and diversity as afforded by the temperature hyperparameter in autoregressive models, hindering understanding of model performance and restricting generation quality. This work proposes the use of classifier-free guidance and stochastic clamping for manipulating the quality-diversity trade-off on sequence-to-sequence tasks, demonstrating that these techniques may be used to improve the performance of a diffusion language model. |[2503.10683v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10683v1)|**[link](https://github.com/zzbuzzard/guidediffuseq)**|
|**2025-03-12**|**Constrained Language Generation with Discrete Diffusion Models**|cs.CL, cs.LG|Constraints are critical in text generation as LLM outputs are often unreliable when it comes to ensuring generated outputs adhere to user defined instruction or general safety guidelines. To address this gap, we present Constrained Discrete Diffusion (CDD), a novel method for enforcing constraints on natural language by integrating discrete diffusion models with differentiable optimization. Unlike conventional text generators, which often rely on post-hoc filtering or model retraining for controllable generation, we propose imposing constraints directly into the discrete diffusion sampling process. We illustrate how this technique can be applied to satisfy a variety of natural language constraints, including (i) toxicity mitigation by preventing harmful content from emerging, (ii) character and sequence level lexical constraints, and (iii) novel molecule sequence generation with specific property adherence. Experimental results show that our constraint-aware procedure achieves high fidelity in meeting these requirements while preserving fluency and semantic coherence, outperforming auto-regressive and existing discrete diffusion approaches. |[2503.09790v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09790v1)|null|
|**2025-03-06**|**Generalized Interpolating Discrete Diffusion**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG|While state-of-the-art language models achieve impressive results through next-token prediction, they have inherent limitations such as the inability to revise already generated tokens. This has prompted exploration of alternative approaches such as discrete diffusion. However, masked diffusion, which has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness, reintroduces this inability to revise words. To overcome this, we generalize masked diffusion and derive the theoretical backbone of a family of general interpolating discrete diffusion (GIDD) processes offering greater flexibility in the design of the noising processes. Leveraging a novel diffusion ELBO, we achieve compute-matched state-of-the-art performance in diffusion language modeling. Exploiting GIDD's flexibility, we explore a hybrid approach combining masking and uniform noise, leading to improved sample quality and unlocking the ability for the model to correct its own mistakes, an area where autoregressive models notoriously have struggled. Our code and models are open-source: https://github.com/dvruette/gidd/ |[2503.04482v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04482v1)|null|
|**2025-03-09**|**DiffPO: Diffusion-styled Preference Optimization for Efficient Inference-Time Alignment of Large Language Models**|cs.CL|Inference-time alignment provides an efficient alternative for aligning LLMs with humans. However, these approaches still face challenges, such as limited scalability due to policy-specific value functions and latency during the inference phase. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Diffusion-styled Preference Optimization (\model), which provides an efficient and policy-agnostic solution for aligning LLMs with humans. By directly performing alignment at sentence level, \model~avoids the time latency associated with token-level generation. Designed as a plug-and-play module, \model~can be seamlessly integrated with various base models to enhance their alignment. Extensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2, MT-bench, and HH-RLHF demonstrate that \model~achieves superior alignment performance across various settings, achieving a favorable trade-off between alignment quality and inference-time latency. Furthermore, \model~demonstrates model-agnostic scalability, significantly improving the performance of large models such as Llama-3-70B. |[2503.04240v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04240v2)|null|
|**2025-03-05**|**BRIDGE: Bootstrapping Text to Control Time-Series Generation via Multi-Agent Iterative Optimization and Diffusion Modelling**|cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.MA|Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by 12.52% on MSE and 6.34% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data. |[2503.02445v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02445v2)|null|
|**2025-02-27**|**EdiText: Controllable Coarse-to-Fine Text Editing with Diffusion Language Models**|cs.CL, cs.LG|We propose EdiText, a controllable text editing method that modify the reference text to desired attributes at various scales. We integrate an SDEdit-based editing technique that allows for broad adjustments in the degree of text editing. Additionally, we introduce a novel fine-level editing method based on self-conditioning, which allows subtle control of reference text. While being capable of editing on its own, this fine-grained method, integrated with the SDEdit approach, enables EdiText to make precise adjustments within the desired range. EdiText demonstrates its controllability to robustly adjust reference text at broad range of levels across various tasks, including toxicity control and sentiment control. |[2502.19765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19765v1)|null|
|**2025-02-19**|**TESS 2: A Large-Scale Generalist Diffusion Language Model**|cs.CL|We introduce TESS 2, a general instruction-following diffusion language model that outperforms contemporary instruction-tuned diffusion models, as well as matches and sometimes exceeds strong autoregressive (AR) models. We train TESS 2 by first adapting a strong AR model via continued pretraining with the usual cross-entropy as diffusion loss, and then performing further instruction tuning. We find that adaptation training as well as the choice of the base model is crucial for training good instruction-following diffusion models. We further propose reward guidance, a novel and modular inference-time guidance procedure to align model outputs without needing to train the underlying model. Finally, we show that TESS 2 further improves with increased inference-time compute, highlighting the utility of diffusion LMs in having fine-grained controllability over the amount of compute used at inference time. Code and models are available at https://github.com/hamishivi/tess-2. |[2502.13917v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13917v1)|**[link](https://github.com/hamishivi/tess-2)**|
|**2025-02-18**|**Large Language Diffusion Models**|cs.CL, cs.LG|Autoregressive models (ARMs) are widely regarded as the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs). We challenge this notion by introducing LLaDA, a diffusion model trained from scratch under the pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) paradigm. LLaDA models distributions through a forward data masking process and a reverse process, parameterized by a vanilla Transformer to predict masked tokens. By optimizing a likelihood bound, it provides a principled generative approach for probabilistic inference. Across extensive benchmarks, LLaDA demonstrates strong scalability, outperforming our self-constructed ARM baselines. Remarkably, LLaDA 8B is competitive with strong LLMs like LLaMA3 8B in in-context learning and, after SFT, exhibits impressive instruction-following abilities in case studies such as multi-turn dialogue. Moreover, LLaDA addresses the reversal curse, surpassing GPT-4o in a reversal poem completion task. Our findings establish diffusion models as a viable and promising alternative to ARMs, challenging the assumption that key LLM capabilities discussed above are inherently tied to ARMs. Project page and codes: https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/. |[2502.09992v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09992v2)|null|
|**2025-02-13**|**Non-Markovian Discrete Diffusion with Causal Language Models**|cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL|Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a flexible and controllable paradigm for structured sequence modeling, yet they still lag behind causal language models in expressiveness. To bridge the gap between two paradigms, we introduce CaDDi, a causal discrete diffusion model that unifies sequential and temporal modeling within a non-Markovian diffusion framework. Unlike conventional diffusion models that operate step by step with no access to prior states, CaDDi integrates the temporal trajectory, enabling more expressive and controllable generation. Our approach also treats causal language models as a special case, allowing seamless adoption of pretrained large language models (LLMs) for discrete diffusion without the need for architectural modifications. Empirically, we demonstrate that CaDDi outperforms state-of-the-art discrete diffusion models on both natural language and biological sequence tasks, narrowing the gap between diffusion-based methods and large-scale autoregressive transformers. |[2502.09767v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09767v1)|null|
|**2025-02-13**|**Theoretical Benefit and Limitation of Diffusion Language Model**|cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, stat.ML|Diffusion language models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation. One would naturally expect this method to be an efficient replacement for autoregressive models since multiple tokens can be sampled in parallel during each diffusion step. However, its efficiency-accuracy trade-off is not yet well understood. In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of a widely used type of diffusion language model, the Masked Diffusion Model (MDM), and find that its effectiveness heavily depends on the target evaluation metric. Under mild conditions, we prove that when using perplexity as the metric, MDMs can achieve near-optimal perplexity in sampling steps regardless of sequence length, demonstrating that efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing performance. However, when using the sequence error rate--which is important for understanding the "correctness" of a sequence, such as a reasoning chain--we show that the required sampling steps must scale linearly with sequence length to obtain "correct" sequences, thereby eliminating MDM's efficiency advantage over autoregressive models. Our analysis establishes the first theoretical foundation for understanding the benefits and limitations of MDMs. All theoretical findings are supported by empirical studies. |[2502.09622v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09622v1)|null|
|**2025-02-05**|**DiffListener: Discrete Diffusion Model for Listener Generation**|cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.GR|The listener head generation (LHG) task aims to generate natural nonverbal listener responses based on the speaker's multimodal cues. While prior work either rely on limited modalities (e.g. audio and facial information) or employ autoregressive approaches which have limitations such as accumulating prediction errors. To address these limitations, we propose DiffListener, a discrete diffusion based approach for non-autoregressive listener head generation. Our model takes the speaker's facial information, audio, and text as inputs, additionally incorporating facial differential information to represent the temporal dynamics of expressions and movements. With this explicit modeling of facial dynamics, DiffListener can generate coherent reaction sequences in a non-autoregressive manner. Through comprehensive experiments, DiffListener demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The user study shows that DiffListener generates natural context-aware listener reactions that are well synchronized with the speaker.

|**2025-03-05**|**Train for the Worst, Plan for the Best: Understanding Token Ordering in Masked Diffusions**|cs.LG|In recent years, masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising alternative approach for generative modeling over discrete domains. Compared to autoregressive models (ARMs), MDMs trade off complexity at training time with flexibility at inference time. At training time, they must learn to solve an exponentially large number of infilling problems, but at inference time, they can decode tokens in essentially arbitrary order. In this work, we closely examine these two competing effects. On the training front, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that MDMs indeed train on computationally intractable subproblems compared to their autoregressive counterparts. On the inference front, we show that a suitable strategy for adaptively choosing the token decoding order significantly enhances the capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to sidestep hard subproblems. On logic puzzles like Sudoku, we show that adaptive inference can boost solving accuracy in pretrained MDMs from <7% to ≈90%, even outperforming ARMs with 7× as many parameters and that were explicitly trained via teacher forcing to learn the right order of decoding.|[2502.06768](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06768)|null|
|**2025-02-03**|**Fine-Tuning Discrete Diffusion Models with Policy Gradient Methods**|stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG|Discrete diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to process complex discrete structures for language modeling. However, fine-tuning these models with policy gradient methods, as is commonly done in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), remains a challenging task. We propose an efficient, broadly applicable, and theoretically justified policy gradient algorithm, called Score Entropy Policy Optimization (SEPO), for fine-tuning discrete diffusion models over non-differentiable rewards. Our numerical experiments across several discrete generative tasks demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ozekri/SEPO |[2502.01384v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01384v1)|**[link](https://github.com/ozekri/SEPO)**|
|**2025-02-02**|**Weak Supervision Dynamic KL-Weighted Diffusion Models Guided by Large Language Models**|cs.CL|In this paper, we presents a novel method for improving text-to-image generation by combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with diffusion models, a hybrid approach aimed at achieving both higher quality and efficiency in image synthesis from text descriptions. Our approach introduces a new dynamic KL-weighting strategy to optimize the diffusion process, along with incorporating semantic understanding from pre-trained LLMs to guide the generation process. The proposed method significantly improves both the visual quality and alignment of generated images with text descriptions, addressing challenges such as computational inefficiency, instability in training, and robustness to textual variability. We evaluate our method on the COCO dataset and demonstrate its superior performance over traditional GAN-based models, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Extensive experiments, including ablation studies and human evaluations, confirm that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of image realism, relevance to the input text, and overall aesthetic quality. Our approach also shows promise in scalability to other multimodal tasks, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of generative applications. |[2502.00826v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00826v1)|null|
|**2025-01-27**|**Large Language Models to Diffusion Finetuning**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG|We propose a new finetuning method to provide pre-trained large language models (LMs) the ability to scale test-time compute through the diffusion framework. By increasing the number of diffusion steps, we show our finetuned models achieve monotonically increasing accuracy, directly translating to improved performance across downstream tasks. Furthermore, our finetuned models can expertly answer questions on specific topics by integrating powerful guidance techniques, and autonomously determine the compute required for a given problem by leveraging adaptive ODE solvers. Our method is universally applicable to any foundation model pre-trained with a cross-entropy loss and does not modify any of its original weights, fully preserving its strong single-step generation capabilities. We show our method is more effective and fully compatible with traditional finetuning approaches, introducing an orthogonal new direction to unify the strengths of the autoregressive and diffusion frameworks. |[2501.15781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15781v1)|null|
|**2025-01-26**|**Cross-Cultural Fashion Design via Interactive Large Language Models and Diffusion Models**|cs.CL|Fashion content generation is an emerging area at the intersection of artificial intelligence and creative design, with applications ranging from virtual try-on to culturally diverse design prototyping. Existing methods often struggle with cultural bias, limited scalability, and alignment between textual prompts and generated visuals, particularly under weak supervision. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to address these challenges. Our method leverages LLMs for semantic refinement of textual prompts and introduces a weak supervision filtering module to effectively utilize noisy or weakly labeled data. By fine-tuning the LDM on an enhanced DeepFashion+ dataset enriched with global fashion styles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and higher Inception Scores (IS), while human evaluations confirm its ability to generate culturally diverse and semantically relevant fashion content. These results highlight the potential of LLM-guided diffusion models in driving scalable and inclusive AI-driven fashion innovation. |[2501.15571v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15571v1)|null|
|**2025-01-26**|**Semantic Layered Embedding Diffusion in Large Language Models for Multi-Contextual Consistency**|cs.CL, cs.AI|The Semantic Layered Embedding Diffusion (SLED) mechanism redefines the representation of hierarchical semantics within transformer-based architectures, enabling enhanced contextual consistency across a wide array of linguistic tasks. By introducing a multi-layered diffusion process grounded in spectral analysis, it achieves a complex balance between global and local semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in perplexity and BLEU scores, emphasizing the mechanism's ability to adapt effectively across diverse domains, including multilingual and cross-domain text generation. A rigorous mathematical framework underpins the embedding diffusion process, incorporating weighted adjacency matrices, kernel-based refinements, and dynamic layer-wise normalization. Error distribution analysis reveals that SLED addresses challenges in semantic alignment and coherence, outperforming baseline approaches across varied benchmarks. Scalability studies illustrate that its performance gains are maintained consistently across different model sizes, reflecting a practical balance between computational efficiency and linguistic precision. The implementation also achieves energy efficiency, reducing resource consumption during training and inference phases without compromising accuracy. Qualitative case studies further validate its adaptability to extended narratives and context-intensive scenarios, highlighting the mechanism's potential for real-world applications. SLED offers a different perspective on embedding design and its implications for advancing language modeling. |[2501.15405v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15405v1)|null|
|**2025-01-26**|**Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion**|cs.AI, cs.CL, I.2.7|Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to address the critical issue of missing knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) for their better applications. However, both the previous MMGKC and negative sampling (NS) approaches ignore the employment of multimodal information to generate diverse and high-quality negative triples from various semantic levels and hardness levels, thereby limiting the effectiveness of training MMKGC models. Thus, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling (DHNS) scheme tailored for MMKGC tasks, which tackles the challenge of generating high-quality negative triples by leveraging a Diffusion-based Hierarchical Embedding Generation (DiffHEG) that progressively conditions on entities and relations as well as multimodal semantics. Furthermore, we develop a Negative Triple-Adaptive Training (NTAT) strategy that dynamically adjusts training margins associated with the hardness level of the synthesized negative triples, facilitating a more robust and effective learning procedure to distinguish between positive and negative triples. Extensive experiments on three MMKGC benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms several state-of-the-art MMKGC models and negative sampling techniques, illustrating the effectiveness of our DHNS for training MMKGC models.

However, this assumption oversimplifies the real document-topic distribution, limiting the model's performance. In response, we propose a novel method that introduces the diffusion process into the sampling process of document-topic distribution to overcome this limitation and maintain an easy optimization process. We validate our method through extensive experiments on two mainstream datasets, proving its effectiveness in improving topic modeling performance. |[2501.00862v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00862v1)|null|
|**2024-12-28**|**AdvAnchor: Enhancing Diffusion Model Unlearning with Adversarial Anchors**|cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL|Security concerns surrounding text-to-image diffusion models have driven researchers to unlearn inappropriate concepts through fine-tuning. Recent fine-tuning methods typically align the prediction distributions of unsafe prompts with those of predefined text anchors. However, these techniques exhibit a considerable performance trade-off between eliminating undesirable concepts and preserving other concepts. In this paper, we systematically analyze the impact of diverse text anchors on unlearning performance. Guided by this analysis, we propose AdvAnchor, a novel approach that generates adversarial anchors to alleviate the trade-off issue. These adversarial anchors are crafted to closely resemble the embeddings of undesirable concepts to maintain overall model performance, while selectively excluding defining attributes of these concepts for effective erasure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdvAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

|**2025-01-05**|**DiffusionAttacker: Diffusion-Driven Prompt Manipulation for LLM Jailbreak**|cs.CL|Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating harmful content when prompted with carefully crafted inputs, a vulnerability known as LLM jailbreaking. As LLMs become more powerful, studying jailbreak methods is critical to enhancing security and aligning models with human values. Traditionally, jailbreak techniques have relied on suffix addition or prompt templates, but these methods suffer from limited attack diversity. This paper introduces DiffusionAttacker, an end-to-end generative approach for jailbreak rewriting inspired by diffusion models. Our method employs a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) text diffusion model as a generator, conditioning on the original prompt and guiding the denoising process with a novel attack loss. Unlike previous approaches that use autoregressive LLMs to generate jailbreak prompts, which limit the modification of already generated tokens and restrict the rewriting space, DiffusionAttacker utilizes a seq2seq diffusion model, allowing more flexible token modifications. This approach preserves the semantic content of the original prompt while producing harmful content. Additionally, we leverage the Gumbel-Softmax technique to make the sampling process from the diffusion model's output distribution differentiable, eliminating the need for iterative token search. Extensive experiments on Advbench and Harmbench demonstrate that DiffusionAttacker outperforms previous methods across various evaluation metrics, including attack success rate (ASR), fluency, and diversity. |[2412.17522v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17522v2)|null|
|**2025-01-06**|**Make Imagination Clearer! Stable Diffusion-based Visual Imagination for Multimodal Machine Translation**|cs.CL|Visual information has been introduced for enhancing machine translation (MT), and its effectiveness heavily relies on the availability of large amounts of bilingual parallel sentence pairs with manual image annotations. In this paper, we introduce a stable diffusion-based imagination network into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to explicitly generate an image for each source sentence, thereby advancing the multimodel MT. Particularly, we build heuristic human feedback with reinforcement learning to ensure the consistency of the generated image with the source sentence without the supervision of image annotation, which breaks the bottleneck of using visual information in MT. Furthermore, the proposed method enables imaginative visual information to be integrated into large-scale text-only MT in addition to multimodal MT. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms existing multimodal MT and text-only MT, especially achieving an average improvement of more than 14 BLEU points on Multi30K multimodal MT benchmarks. |[2412.12627v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12627v2)|null|

Token-level diffusion overlooks word-order dependencies and enforces short output windows, while passage-level diffusion struggles with learning robust representation for long-form text. To address these challenges, we propose Segment-Level Diffusion (SLD), a framework that enhances diffusion-based text generation through text segmentation, robust representation training with adversarial and contrastive learning, and improved latent-space guidance. By segmenting long-form outputs into separate latent representations and decoding them with an autoregressive decoder, SLD simplifies diffusion predictions and improves scalability. Experiments on XSum, ROCStories, DialogSum, and DeliData demonstrate that SLD achieves competitive or superior performance in fluency, coherence, and contextual compatibility across automatic and human evaluation metrics comparing with other diffusion and autoregressive baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our segmentation and representation learning strategies. |[2412.11333v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11333v1)|null|

We find that, unlike models tuned on high-quality images with multilingual annotations, leveraging text encoders pre-trained on widely available, noisy Internet image-text pairs significantly enhances data efficiency in text-to-image (T2I) generation across multiple languages. Based on this insight, we introduce MuLan, Multi-Language adapter, a lightweight language adapter with fewer than 20M parameters, trained alongside a frozen text encoder and image diffusion model. Compared to previous multilingual T2I models, this framework offers: (1) Cost efficiency. Using readily accessible English data and off-the-shelf multilingual text encoders minimizes the training cost; (2) High performance. Achieving comparable generation capabilities in over 110 languages with CLIP similarity scores nearly matching those in English (38.61 for English vs. 37.61 for other languages); and (3) Broad applicability. Seamlessly integrating with compatible community tools like LoRA, LCM, ControlNet, and IP-Adapter, expanding its potential use cases. |[2412.01271v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01271v1)|null|
|**2024-12-20**|**PLM-Based Discrete Diffusion Language Models with Entropy-Adaptive Gibbs Sampling**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Recently, discrete diffusion language models have demonstrated promising results in NLP. However, there has been limited research on integrating Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) into discrete diffusion models, resulting in underwhelming performance in downstream NLP generation tasks. This integration is particularly challenging because of the discrepancy between step-wise denoising strategy of diffusion models and single-step mask prediction approach of MLM-based PLMs. In this paper, we introduce Diffusion-EAGS, a novel approach that effectively integrates PLMs with the diffusion models. Furthermore, as it is challenging for PLMs to determine where to apply denoising during the diffusion process, we integrate an entropy tracking module to assist them. Finally, we propose entropy-based noise scheduling in the forward process to improve the effectiveness of entropy-adaptive sampling throughout the generation phase. Experimental results show that Diffusion-EAGS outperforms existing diffusion baselines in downstream generation tasks, achieving high text quality and diversity with precise token-level control. We also show that our model is capable of adapting to bilingual and low-resource settings, which are common in real-world applications. |[2411.06438v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06438v2)|null|

However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs' limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data. To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module. As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully expressive latent distribution. Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with structured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code and Tool data) demonstrate that DiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks surpassing that of real data by 2-7 percent in certain cases. The data and code will be publicly available upon completion of internal review. |[2411.03250v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03250v1)|null|
|**2024-11-03**|**DPCL-Diff: The Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning based on Graph Node Diffusion Model with Dual-Domain Periodic Contrastive Learning**|cs.LG, cs.CL|Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning that infers future missing facts is an essential and challenging task. Predicting future events typically relies on closely related historical facts, yielding more accurate results for repetitive or periodic events. However, for future events with sparse historical interactions, the effectiveness of this method, which focuses on leveraging high-frequency historical information, diminishes. Recently, the capabilities of diffusion models in image generation have opened new opportunities for TKG reasoning. Therefore, we propose a graph node diffusion model with dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL-Diff). Graph node diffusion model (GNDiff) introduces noise into sparsely related events to simulate new events, generating high-quality data that better conforms to the actual distribution. This generative mechanism significantly enhances the model's ability to reason about new events. Additionally, the dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL) maps periodic and non-periodic event entities to Poincar\'e and Euclidean spaces, leveraging their characteristics to distinguish similar periodic events effectively. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that DPCL-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TKG models in event prediction, demonstrating our approach's effectiveness. This study also investigates the combined effectiveness of GNDiff and DPCL in TKG tasks. |[2411.01477v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01477v1)|null|

Recent research shows their strengths, with performance reaching that of auto-regressive LLMs. But are they also good in generating synthetic data if the training was under differential privacy? Here the evidence is missing, yet the promises from private image generation look strong. In this paper we address this open question by extensive experiments. At the same time, we critically assess (and reimplement) previous works on synthetic private text generation with LLMs and reveal some unmet assumptions that might have led to violating the differential privacy guarantees. Our results partly contradict previous non-private findings and show that fully open-source LLMs outperform diffusion models in the privacy regime. Our complete source codes, datasets, and experimental setup is publicly available to foster future research. |[2410.22971v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22971v1)|**[link](https://github.com/trusthlt/private-synthetic-text-generation)**|
|**2024-10-28**|**Energy-Based Diffusion Language Models for Text Generation**|cs.CL, cs.LG|Despite remarkable progress in autoregressive language models, alternative generative paradigms beyond left-to-right generation are still being actively explored. Discrete diffusion models, with the capacity for parallel generation, have recently emerged as a promising alternative. Unfortunately, these models still underperform the autoregressive counterparts, with the performance gap increasing when reducing the number of sampling steps. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is a consequence of an imperfect approximation used by diffusion models. In this work, we propose Energy-based Diffusion Language Model (EDLM), an energy-based model operating at the full sequence level for each diffusion step, introduced to improve the underlying approximation used by diffusion models. More specifically, we introduce an EBM in a residual form, and show that its parameters can be obtained by leveraging a pretrained autoregressive model or by finetuning a bidirectional transformer via noise contrastive estimation. We also propose an efficient generation algorithm via parallel important sampling. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks show that our model can consistently outperform state-of-the-art diffusion models by a significant margin, and approaches autoregressive models' perplexity. We further show that, without any generation performance drop, our framework offers a 1.3$\times$ sampling speedup over existing diffusion models. |[2410.21357v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21357v1)|null|
|**2024-12-20**|**Scaling up Masked Diffusion Models on Text**|cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG|Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have shown promise in language modeling, yet their scalability and effectiveness in core language tasks, such as text generation and language understanding, remain underexplored. This paper establishes the first scaling law for MDMs, demonstrating a scaling rate comparable to autoregressive models (ARMs) and a relatively small compute gap. Motivated by their scalability, we train a family of MDMs with up to 1.1 billion (B) parameters to systematically evaluate their performance against ARMs of comparable or larger sizes. Fully leveraging the probabilistic formulation of MDMs, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised classifier-free guidance that effectively exploits large-scale unpaired data, boosting performance for conditional inference. In language understanding, the 1.1B MDM outperforms the 1.1B TinyLlama model trained on the same data across four of eight zero-shot benchmarks. Notably, it achieves competitive math reasoning ability with the 7B Llama-2 model on the GSM8K dataset. In text generation, MDMs provide a flexible trade-off compared to ARMs utilizing KV-cache: MDMs match the performance of ARMs while being 1.4 times faster or achieving higher quality than ARMs at a higher computational cost. Moreover, MDMs address challenging tasks for ARMs by effectively handling bidirectional reasoning and adapting to temporal shifts in data. Notably, a 1.1B MDM breaks the reverse curse encountered by much larger ARMs with significantly more data and computation, such as 13B Llama-2 and 175B GPT-3.

However, current DLMs have been studied at a smaller scale compared to their AR counterparts and lack fair comparison on language modeling benchmarks. Additionally, training diffusion models from scratch at scale remains challenging. Given the prevalence of open-source AR language models, we propose adapting these models to build text diffusion models. We demonstrate connections between AR and diffusion modeling objectives and introduce a simple continual pre-training approach for training diffusion models. Through systematic evaluation on language modeling, reasoning, and commonsense benchmarks, we show that we can convert AR models ranging from 127M to 7B parameters (GPT2 and LLaMA) into diffusion models DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, using less than 200B tokens for training. Our experimental results reveal that these models outperform earlier DLMs and are competitive with their AR counterparts. We release a suite of DLMs (with 127M, 355M, and 7B parameters) capable of generating fluent text, performing in-context learning, filling in the middle without prompt re-ordering, and following instructions \url{https://github.com/HKUNLP/DiffuLLaMA}. |[2410.17891v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17891v1)|**[link](https://github.com/hkunlp/diffullama)**|

We introduce discrete diffusion models as a novel solution to these challenges. Through the lens of subgoal imbalance, we demonstrate how diffusion models effectively learn difficult subgoals that elude autoregressive approaches. We propose Multi-granularity Diffusion Modeling (MDM), which prioritizes subgoals based on difficulty during learning. On complex tasks like Countdown, Sudoku, and Boolean Satisfiability Problems, MDM significantly outperforms autoregressive models without using search techniques. For instance, MDM achieves 91.5\% and 100\% accuracy on Countdown and Sudoku, respectively, compared to 45.8\% and 20.7\% for autoregressive models. Our work highlights the potential of diffusion-based approaches in advancing AI capabilities for sophisticated language understanding and problem-solving tasks. |[2410.14157v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14157v1)|**[link](https://github.com/HKUNLP/diffusion-vs-ar)**|

It has been adapted for sequence-to-sequence text generation (Seq2Seq) through DiffuSeq, termed S2S Diffusion. Existing S2S-Diffusion models predominantly rely on fixed or hand-crafted rules to schedule noise during the diffusion and denoising processes. However, these models are limited by non-contextualized noise, which fails to fully consider the characteristics of Seq2Seq tasks. In this paper, we propose the Meta-DiffuB framework - a novel scheduler-exploiter S2S-Diffusion paradigm designed to overcome the limitations of existing S2S-Diffusion models. We employ Meta-Exploration to train an additional scheduler model dedicated to scheduling contextualized noise for each sentence. Our exploiter model, an S2S-Diffusion model, leverages the noise scheduled by our scheduler model for updating and generation. Meta-DiffuB achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous S2S-Diffusion models and fine-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) across four Seq2Seq benchmark datasets. We further investigate and visualize the impact of Meta-DiffuB's noise scheduling on the generation of sentences with varying difficulties. Additionally, our scheduler model can function as a "plug-and-play" model to enhance DiffuSeq without the need for fine-tuning during the inference stage. |[2410.13201v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13201v1)|**[link](https://github.com/meta-diffub/meta-diffub)**|

Computational frameworks have been developed to capture the complex relationship between microstructure and material behavior. However, despite these advancements, the steep learning curve associated with domain-specific knowledge and complex algorithms restricts the broader application of these tools. To lower this barrier, we propose a framework that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to enable microstructure design using intuitive natural language commands. Our framework employs contextual data augmentation, driven by a pretrained LLM, to generate and expand a diverse dataset of microstructure descriptors. A retrained NER model extracts relevant microstructure descriptors from user-provided natural language inputs, which are then used by the DDPM to generate microstructures with targeted mechanical properties and topological features. The NLP and DDPM components of the framework are modular, allowing for separate training and validation, which ensures flexibility in adapting the framework to different datasets and use cases. A surrogate model system is employed to rank and filter generated samples based on their alignment with target properties. Demonstrated on a database of nonlinear hyperelastic microstructures, this framework serves as a prototype for accessible inverse design of microstructures, starting from intuitive natural language commands. |[2409.14473v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14473v1)|null|

In this systematic study, we investigate their application to the table-to-text problem by adapting the diffusion model to the task and conducting an in-depth analysis. Our experiments cover multiple aspects of diffusion models training. We explore sampling strategy influence by inducing recent diffusion model accelerator DPM-Solver++ into our core model. We have tested different prediction aggregation methods, like ROVER and Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR). Our studies cover the impact of the pre-training phase in diffusion models and the generation length constraints influence. We also have compared diffusion model generation with auto-regressive text-to-text models with different temperature settings for diversity evaluation. Our key observation is that diffusion models demonstrate the balance between quality and diversity while auto-regressive text-to-text models are not successful at handling both at the same time. Furthermore, we found out that to achieve the highest quality possible, it is preferable to use a regular sampler with the strictest length constraint to create multiple samples, and then use MBR to aggregate the predictions. However, if you are prepared to give up high level of diversity and to accelerate the process, you can also utilize a fast sampler DPM-Solver++. Our findings reveal that diffusion models achieve comparable results in the table-to-text domain, highlighting their viability in the table-to-text challenge as a promising research direction. |[2409.13739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13739v1)|null|

Most current recommender systems provide recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or content-based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion, they do not incorporate classifier-free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance and also incorporates classifier-free guidance.

Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect the mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations. |[2409.10289v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10289v2)|null|

Our diffusion-based framework offers unique advantages stemming from its inherent stochasticity and holistic context modeling in captioning. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that DAC not only achieves SOTA performance levels compared to existing benchmarks in the caption quality, but also significantly outperforms them in terms of generation speed and diversity. The success of DAC illustrates that text generation can also be seamlessly integrated with audio and visual generation tasks using a diffusion backbone, paving the way for a unified, audio-related generative model across different modalities. |[2409.09401v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09401v1)|null|
|**2024-09-23**|**An Effective Deployment of Diffusion LM for Data Augmentation in Low-Resource Sentiment Classification**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Sentiment classification (SC) often suffers from low-resource challenges such as domain-specific contexts, imbalanced label distributions, and few-shot scenarios. The potential of the diffusion language model (LM) for textual data augmentation (DA) remains unexplored, moreover, textual DA methods struggle to balance the diversity and consistency of new samples. Most DA methods either perform logical modifications or rephrase less important tokens in the original sequence with the language model. In the context of SC, strong emotional tokens could act critically on the sentiment of the whole sequence. Therefore, contrary to rephrasing less important context, we propose DiffusionCLS to leverage a diffusion LM to capture in-domain knowledge and generate pseudo samples by reconstructing strong label-related tokens. This approach ensures a balance between consistency and diversity, avoiding the introduction of noise and augmenting crucial features of datasets. DiffusionCLS also comprises a Noise-Resistant Training objective to help the model generalize. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various low-resource scenarios including domain-specific and domain-general problems. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our framework's modules, and visualization studies highlight optimal deployment conditions, reinforcing our conclusions. |[2409.03203v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03203v2)|**[link](https://github.com/johnnychanv/diffusioncls)**|

The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair. |[2409.02908v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02908v3)|null|

To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an adaptation of speculative decoding which uses discrete diffusion models to generate draft sequences. This allows parallelization of both the drafting and verification steps, providing significant speed-ups to the inference process. Our proposed approach, Speculative Diffusion Decoding (SpecDiff), is validated on standard language generation benchmarks and empirically demonstrated to provide a up to 8.7x speed-up over standard generation processes and up to 2.5x speed-up over existing speculative decoding approaches. |[2408.05636v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05636v2)|null|
|**2024-08-08**|**Diffusion Guided Language Modeling**|cs.CL, cs.LG|Current language models demonstrate remarkable proficiency in text generation. However, for many applications it is desirable to control attributes, such as sentiment, or toxicity, of the generated language -- ideally tailored towards each specific use case and target audience. For auto-regressive language models, existing guidance methods are prone to decoding errors that cascade during generation and degrade performance. In contrast, text diffusion models can easily be guided with, for example, a simple linear sentiment classifier -- however they do suffer from significantly higher perplexity than auto-regressive alternatives. In this paper we use a guided diffusion model to produce a latent proposal that steers an auto-regressive language model to generate text with desired properties. Our model inherits the unmatched fluency of the auto-regressive approach and the plug-and-play flexibility of diffusion. We show that it outperforms previous plug-and-play guidance methods across a wide range of benchmark data sets. Further, controlling a new attribute in our framework is reduced to training a single logistic regression classifier. |[2408.04220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04220v1)|**[link](https://github.com/justinlovelace/diffusion-guided-lm)**|

Taking the generation of a combination of two disentangled concepts as an example, say given the prompt "a tea cup of iced coke", existing models usually generate a glass cup of iced coke because the iced coke usually co-occurs with the glass cup instead of the tea one during model training. The root of such misalignment is attributed to the confusion in the latent semantic space of text-to-image diffusion models, and hence we refer to the "a tea cup of iced coke" phenomenon as Latent Concept Misalignment (LC-Mis). We leverage large language models (LLMs) to thoroughly investigate the scope of LC-Mis, and develop an automated pipeline for aligning the latent semantics of diffusion models to text prompts. Empirical assessments confirm the effectiveness of our approach, substantially reducing LC-Mis errors and enhancing the robustness and versatility of text-to-image diffusion models.

|**2024-07-17**|**The Role of Network and Identity in the Diffusion of Hashtags**|cs.SI, cs.CL, cs.CY|Although the spread of behaviors is influenced by many social factors, existing literature tends to study the effects of single factors -- most often, properties of the social network -- on the final cascade. In order to move towards a more integrated view of cascades, this paper offers the first comprehensive investigation into the role of two social factors in the diffusion of 1,337 popular hashtags representing the production of novel culture on Twitter: 1) the topology of the Twitter social network and 2) performance of each user's probable demographic identity. Here, we show that cascades are best modeled using a combination of network and identity, rather than either factor alone. This combined model best reproduces a composite index of ten cascade properties across all 1,337 hashtags. However, there is important heterogeneity in what social factors are required to reproduce different properties of hashtag cascades. For instance, while a combined network+identity model best predicts the popularity of cascades, a network-only model has better performance in predicting cascade growth and an identity-only model in adopter composition. We are able to predict what type of hashtag is best modeled by each combination of features and use this to further improve performance. Additionally, consistent with prior literature on the combined network+identity model most outperforms the single-factor counterfactuals among hashtags used for expressing racial or regional identity, stance-taking, talking about sports, or variants of existing cultural trends with very slow- or fast-growing communicative need. In sum, our results imply the utility of multi-factor models in predicting cascades, in order to account for the varied ways in which network, identity, and other social factors play a role in the diffusion of hashtags on Twitter. |[2407.12771v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12771v1)|null|

In this work, we address the limitations of prior discrete diffusion models for conditional long-text generation, particularly in long sequence-to-sequence tasks such as abstractive summarization. Despite fast decoding speeds compared to autoregressive methods, previous diffusion models failed on the abstractive summarization task due to the incompatibility between the backbone architectures and the random noising process. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel semantic-aware noising process that enables Transformer backbones to handle long sequences effectively. Additionally, we propose CrossMamba, an adaptation of the Mamba model to the encoder-decoder paradigm, which integrates seamlessly with the random absorbing noising process. Our approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark summarization datasets: Gigaword, CNN/DailyMail, and Arxiv, outperforming existing discrete diffusion models on ROUGE metrics as well as possessing much faster speed in inference compared to autoregressive models. |[2407.10998v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10998v1)|null|
|**2024-07-10**|**Promises, Outlooks and Challenges of Diffusion Language Modeling**|cs.CL, cs.AI|The modern autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance on NLP benchmarks, and they are deployed in the real world. However, they still suffer from limitations of the autoregressive training paradigm. For example, autoregressive token generation is notably slow and can be prone to \textit{exposure bias}. The diffusion-based language models were proposed as an alternative to autoregressive generation to address some of these limitations. We evaluate the recently proposed Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion (SEDD) approach and show it is a promising alternative to autoregressive generation but it has some short-comings too. We empirically demonstrate the advantages and challenges of SEDD, and observe that SEDD generally matches autoregressive models in perplexity and on benchmarks such as HellaSwag, Arc or WinoGrande. Additionally, we show that in terms of inference latency, SEDD can be up to 4.5$\times$ more efficient than GPT-2. While SEDD allows conditioning on tokens at abitrary positions, SEDD appears slightly weaker than GPT-2 for conditional generation given short prompts. Finally, we reproduced the main results from the original SEDD paper. |[2406.11473v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11473v2)|null|
|**2024-06-11**|**Simple and Effective Masked Diffusion Language Models**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG|While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, prior work reports a significant performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive (AR) methods in language modeling. In this work, we show that simple masked discrete diffusion is more performant than previously thought. We apply an effective training recipe that improves the performance of masked diffusion models and derive a simplified, Rao-Blackwellized objective that results in additional improvements. Our objective has a simple form -- it is a mixture of classical masked language modeling losses -- and can be used to train encoder-only language models that admit efficient samplers, including ones that can generate arbitrary lengths of text semi-autoregressively like a traditional language model. On language modeling benchmarks, a range of masked diffusion models trained with modern engineering practices achieves a new state-of-the-art among diffusion models, and approaches AR perplexity.

|**2024-07-06**|**Your Absorbing Discrete Diffusion Secretly Models the Conditional Distributions of Clean Data**|cs.LG, cs.CL|Discrete diffusion models with absorbing processes have shown promise in language modeling. The key quantities to be estimated are the ratios between the marginal probabilities of two transitive states at all timesteps, called the concrete score. In this paper, we reveal that the concrete score in absorbing diffusion can be expressed as conditional probabilities of clean data, multiplied by a time-dependent scalar in an analytic form. Motivated by this finding, we propose reparameterized absorbing discrete diffusion (RADD), a dedicated diffusion model without time-condition that characterizes the time-independent conditional probabilities. Besides its simplicity, RADD can reduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs) by caching the output of the time-independent network when the noisy sample remains unchanged in a sampling interval. Empirically, RADD is up to 3.5 times faster while achieving similar performance with the strongest baseline. Built upon the new perspective of conditional distributions, we further unify absorbing discrete diffusion and any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs), showing that the upper bound on the negative log-likelihood for the diffusion model can be interpreted as an expected negative log-likelihood for AO-ARMs. Further, our RADD models achieve SOTA performance among diffusion models on 5 zero-shot language modeling benchmarks (measured by perplexity) at the GPT-2 scale. Our code is available at https://github.com/ML-GSAI/RADD. |[2406.03736v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03736v2)|**[link](https://github.com/ml-gsai/radd)**|

However, current models face multiple drawbacks including slow sampling, noise schedule sensitivity, and misalignment between the training and sampling stages. In this paper, we introduce FlowSeq, which bypasses all current drawbacks by leveraging flow matching for conditional text generation. FlowSeq can generate text in a few steps by training with a novel anchor loss, alleviating the need for expensive hyperparameter optimization of the noise schedule prevalent in diffusion models. We extensively evaluate our proposed method and show competitive performance in tasks such as question generation, open-domain dialogue, and paraphrasing. |[EACL24](https://aclanthology.org/2024.eacl-short.33.pdf)|**[link](https://taohu.me/project_flowseq/)**|

Inspired by recent advances in large language models, there is a growing interest in using natural language descriptions of molecules to generate molecules with the desired properties. Most existing methods focus on generating molecules that precisely match the text description. However, practical applications call for methods that generate diverse, and ideally novel, molecules with the desired properties. We propose 3M-Diffusion, a novel multi-modal molecular graph generation method, to address this challenge. 3M-Diffusion first encodes molecular graphs into a graph latent space aligned with text descriptions. It then reconstructs the molecular structure and atomic attributes based on the given text descriptions using the molecule decoder. It then learns a probabilistic mapping from the text space to the latent molecular graph space using a diffusion model. The results of our extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that 3M-Diffusion can generate high-quality, novel and diverse molecular graphs that semantically match the textual description provided. |[2403.07179v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07179v1)|**[link](https://github.com/huaishengzhu/3mdiffusion)**|

Previous studies predominantly focus on learning contextual information in conversations with only a few considering the topic information in single language modality, while always neglecting the acoustic and vision topic information. On this basis, we propose a model-agnostic Topic-enriched Diffusion (TopicDiff) approach for capturing multimodal topic information in MCE tasks. Particularly, we integrate the diffusion model into neural topic model to alleviate the diversity deficiency problem of neural topic model in capturing topic information. Detailed evaluations demonstrate the significant improvements of TopicDiff over the state-of-the-art MCE baselines, justifying the importance of multimodal topic information to MCE and the effectiveness of TopicDiff in capturing such information. Furthermore, we observe an interesting finding that the topic information in acoustic and vision is more discriminative and robust compared to the language. |[2403.04789v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04789v1)|null|

However, inherent shortcomings such as redundant information and incomplete triple recognition remain problematic. To address these challenges, we propose an Implicit Perspective for relational triple Extraction based on Diffusion model (IPED), an innovative approach for extracting relational triples. Our classifier-free solution adopts an implicit strategy using block coverage to complete the tables, avoiding the limitations of explicit tagging methods. Additionally, we introduce a generative model structure, the block-denoising diffusion model, to collaborate with our implicit perspective and effectively circumvent redundant information disruptions. Experimental results on two popular datasets demonstrate that IPED achieves state-of-the-art performance while gaining superior inference speed and low computational complexity. To support future research, we have made our source code publicly available online. |[2403.00808v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00808v1)|null|

Despite these efforts, none of them has managed to achieve the quality of the large language models. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of key components of the text diffusion models and introduce a novel approach named Text Encoding Diffusion Model (TEncDM). Instead of the commonly used token embedding space, we train our model in the space of the language model encodings. Additionally, we propose to use a Transformer-based decoder that utilizes contextual information for text reconstruction. We also analyse self-conditioning and find that it increases the magnitude of the model outputs, allowing the reduction of the number of denoising steps at the inference stage. Evaluation of TEncDM on two downstream text generation tasks, QQP and XSum, demonstrates its superiority over existing non-autoregressive models. |[2402.19097v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19097v1)|null|

In this work, we develop a series of knowledge models, DiffuCOMET, that leverage diffusion to learn to reconstruct the implicit semantic connections between narrative contexts and relevant commonsense knowledge. Across multiple diffusion steps, our method progressively refines a representation of commonsense facts that is anchored to a narrative, producing contextually-relevant and diverse commonsense inferences for an input context. To evaluate DiffuCOMET, we introduce new metrics for commonsense inference that more closely measure knowledge diversity and contextual relevance. Our results on two different benchmarks, ComFact and WebNLG+, show that knowledge generated by DiffuCOMET achieves a better trade-off between commonsense diversity, contextual relevance and alignment to known gold references, compared to baseline knowledge models. |[2402.17011v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17011v1)|**[link](https://github.com/silin159/diffucomet)**|

However, a notable challenge in ABSA lies in precisely determining the aspects' boundaries (start and end indices), especially for long ones, due to users' colloquial expressions. We propose DiffusionABSA, a novel diffusion model tailored for ABSA, which extracts the aspects progressively step by step. Particularly, DiffusionABSA gradually adds noise to the aspect terms in the training process, subsequently learning a denoising process that progressively restores these terms in a reverse manner. To estimate the boundaries, we design a denoising neural network enhanced by a syntax-aware temporal attention mechanism to chronologically capture the interplay between aspects and surrounding text. Empirical evaluations conducted on eight benchmark datasets underscore the compelling advantages offered by DiffusionABSA when compared against robust baseline models.

Due to their adaptiveness in iterative refinement, they provide a strong potential for achieving better non-autoregressive sequence generation. However, existing text diffusion models still fall short in their performance due to a challenge in handling the discreteness of language. This paper thoroughly analyzes text diffusion models and uncovers two significant limitations: degradation of self-conditioning during training and misalignment between training and sampling. Motivated by our findings, we propose a novel Text Diffusion model called TREC, which mitigates the degradation with Reinforced Conditioning and the misalignment by Time-Aware Variance Scaling. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of TREC against autoregressive, non-autoregressive, and diffusion baselines. Moreover, qualitative analysis shows its advanced ability to fully utilize the diffusion process in refining samples. |[2402.14843v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14843v1)|null|

Analyzing a large dataset of sampled English tweets, we examine how newly released emojis gain traction and evolve in meaning. We find that community size of early adopters and emoji semantics are crucial in determining their popularity. Certain emojis experienced notable shifts in the meanings and sentiment associations during the diffusion process. Additionally, we propose a novel framework utilizing language models to extract words and pre-existing emojis with semantically similar contexts, which enhances interpretation of new emojis. The framework demonstrates its effectiveness in improving sentiment classification performance by substituting unknown new emojis with familiar ones.

|**2024-02-21**|**The Geography of Information Diffusion in Online Discourse on Europe and Migration**|cs.CL, cs.SI|The online diffusion of information related to Europe and migration has been little investigated from an external point of view. However, this is a very relevant topic, especially if users have had no direct contact with Europe and its perception depends solely on information retrieved online. In this work we analyse the information circulating online about Europe and migration after retrieving a large amount of data from social media (Twitter), to gain new insights into topics, magnitude, and dynamics of their diffusion. We combine retweets and hashtags network analysis with geolocation of users, linking thus data to geography and allowing analysis from an "outside Europe" perspective, with a special focus on Africa. We also introduce a novel approach based on cross-lingual quotes, i.e. when content in a language is commented and retweeted in another language, assuming these interactions are a proxy for connections between very distant communities. Results show how the majority of online discussions occurs at a national level, especially when discussing migration. Language (English) is pivotal for information to become transnational and reach far. Transnational information flow is strongly unbalanced, with content mainly produced in Europe and amplified outside. Conversely Europe-based accounts tend to be self-referential when they discuss migration-related topics. Football is the most exported topic from Europe worldwide. Moreover, important nodes in the communities discussing migration-related topics include accounts of official institutions and international agencies, together with journalists, news, commentators and activists. |[2402.13800v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13800v1)|null|

Recently, most existing SMILES-based molecule generation methods rely on an autoregressive architecture. In this work, we propose the Text-Guided Molecule Generation with Diffusion Language Model (TGM-DLM), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to address the limitations of autoregressive methods. TGM-DLM updates token embeddings within the SMILES string collectively and iteratively, using a two-phase diffusion generation process. The first phase optimizes embeddings from random noise, guided by the text description, while the second phase corrects invalid SMILES strings to form valid molecular representations. We demonstrate that TGM-DLM outperforms MolT5-Base, an autoregressive model, without the need for additional data resources. Our findings underscore the remarkable effectiveness of TGM-DLM in generating coherent and precise molecules with specific properties, opening new avenues in drug discovery and related scientific domains.

In this paper, we incorporate Thinker with the Drift-Diffusion Model (Thinker-DDM) to address this issue. We then redefine the Drift-Diffusion process to emulate human translators' dynamic decision-making under constrained resources. We conduct extensive experiments under the high-resource, low-resource, and commonsense translation settings using the WMT22 and CommonMT datasets, in which Thinker-DDM outperforms baselines in the first two scenarios.

|**2024-02-15**|**Quantized Embedding Vectors for Controllable Diffusion Language Models**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Improving the controllability, portability, and inference speed of diffusion language models (DLMs) is a key challenge in natural language generation. While recent research has shown significant success in complex text generation with language models, the memory and computational power are still very demanding and fall short of expectations, which naturally results in low portability and instability for the models. To mitigate these issues, numerous well-established methods were proposed for neural network quantization. To further enhance their portability of independent deployment as well as improve their stability evaluated by language perplexity, we propose a novel approach called the Quantized Embedding Controllable Diffusion Language Model (QE-CDLM). QE-CDLM builds upon the recent successful controllable DLMs by remodeling the task-specific embedding space via quantization. This leads to a gradient-based controller for the generation tasks, and more stable intermediate latent variables are obtained, which naturally brings in an accelerated convergence as well as better controllability. Additionally, the adaption fine-tuning method is employed to reduce tunable weights. Experimental results on five challenging fine-grained control tasks demonstrate that QE-CDLM compares favorably to existing methods in terms of quality and feasibility, achieving better perplexity and lightweight fine-tuning. |[2402.10107v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10107v1)|null|

In contrast to traditional autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT offers more flexibility in the trade-off between computation and reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication and grade school math problems. Additionally, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding.

|**2024-02-09**|**Diffusion-ES: Gradient-free Planning with Diffusion for Autonomous Driving and Zero-Shot Instruction Following**|cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.RO|Diffusion models excel at modeling complex and multimodal trajectory distributions for decision-making and control. Reward-gradient guided denoising has been recently proposed to generate trajectories that maximize both a differentiable reward function and the likelihood under the data distribution captured by a diffusion model. Reward-gradient guided denoising requires a differentiable reward function fitted to both clean and noised samples, limiting its applicability as a general trajectory optimizer. In this paper, we propose DiffusionES, a method that combines gradient-free optimization with trajectory denoising to optimize black-box non-differentiable objectives while staying in the data manifold. Diffusion-ES samples trajectories during evolutionary search from a diffusion model and scores them using a black-box reward function. It mutates high-scoring trajectories using a truncated diffusion process that applies a small number of noising and denoising steps, allowing for much more efficient exploration of the solution space. We show that DiffusionES achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuPlan, an established closed-loop planning benchmark for autonomous driving. Diffusion-ES outperforms existing sampling-based planners, reactive deterministic or diffusion-based policies, and reward-gradient guidance. Additionally, we show that unlike prior guidance methods, our method can optimize non-differentiable language-shaped reward functions generated by few-shot LLM prompting. When guided by a human teacher that issues instructions to follow, our method can generate novel, highly complex behaviors, such as aggressive lane weaving, which are not present in the training data. This allows us to solve the hardest nuPlan scenarios which are beyond the capabilities of existing trajectory optimization methods and driving policies. |[2402.06559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06559v1)|null|
|**2024-01-30**|**Transfer Learning for Text Diffusion Models**|cs.CL|In this report, we explore the potential for text diffusion to replace autoregressive (AR) decoding for the training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). We are particularly interested to see whether pretrained AR models can be transformed into text diffusion models through a lightweight adaptation procedure we call ``AR2Diff''. We begin by establishing a strong baseline setup for training text diffusion models. Comparing across multiple architectures and pretraining objectives, we find that training a decoder-only model with a prefix LM objective is best or near-best across several tasks. Building on this finding, we test various transfer learning setups for text diffusion models. On machine translation, we find that text diffusion underperforms the standard AR approach. However, on code synthesis and extractive QA, we find diffusion models trained from scratch outperform AR models in many cases. We also observe quality gains from AR2Diff -- adapting AR models to use diffusion decoding. These results are promising given that text diffusion is relatively underexplored and can be significantly faster than AR decoding for long text generation. |[2401.17181v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17181v1)|null|
|**2024-01-09**|**ROIC-DM: Robust Text Inference and Classification via Diffusion Model**|cs.CL|While language models have made many milestones in text inference and classification tasks, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that can lead to unforeseen outcomes. Existing works alleviate this problem by equipping language models with defense patches. However, these defense strategies often rely on impractical assumptions or entail substantial sacrifices in model performance. Consequently, enhancing the resilience of the target model using such defense mechanisms is a formidable challenge. This paper introduces an innovative model for robust text inference and classification, built upon diffusion models (ROIC-DM). Benefiting from its training involving denoising stages, ROIC-DM inherently exhibits greater robustness compared to conventional language models. Moreover, ROIC-DM can attain comparable, and in some cases, superior performance to language models, by effectively incorporating them as advisory components. Extensive experiments conducted with several strong textual adversarial attacks on three datasets demonstrate that (1) ROIC-DM outperforms traditional language models in robustness, even when the latter are fortified with advanced defense mechanisms; (2) ROIC-DM can achieve comparable and even better performance than traditional language models by using them as advisors. |[2401.03514v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03514v2)|null|

Traditional traffic prediction methods rely only on historical traffic data to predict traffic trends and face two main challenges. 1) insensitivity to unusual events. 2) poor performance in long-term prediction. In this work, we explore how generative models combined with text describing the traffic system can be applied for traffic generation and name the task Text-to-Traffic Generation (TTG). The key challenge of the TTG task is how to associate text with the spatial structure of the road network and traffic data for generating traffic situations. To this end, we propose ChatTraffic, the first diffusion model for text-to-traffic generation. To guarantee the consistency between synthetic and real data, we augment a diffusion model with the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to extract spatial correlations of traffic data. In addition, we construct a large dataset containing text-traffic pairs for the TTG task. We benchmarked our model qualitatively and quantitatively on the released dataset.

We evaluate CodeFusion on the task of natural language to code generation for Bash, Python, and Microsoft Excel conditional formatting (CF) rules. Experiments show that CodeFusion (75M parameters) performs on par with state-of-the-art auto-regressive systems (350M-175B parameters) in top-1 accuracy and outperforms them in top-3 and top-5 accuracy due to its better balance in diversity versus quality. |[2310.17680v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17680v3)|null|

Specifically, due to the low information density of speech data, the transformed discrete speech unit sequence is much longer than the corresponding text transcription, posing significant challenges to existing auto-regressive models. Furthermore, it is not optimal to brutally apply discrete diffusion on the speech unit sequence while disregarding the continuous space structure, which will degrade the generation performance significantly. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model by applying the diffusion forward process in the \textit{continuous} speech representation space, while employing the diffusion backward process in the \textit{discrete} speech unit space. In this way, we preserve the semantic structure of the continuous speech representation space in the diffusion process and integrate the continuous and discrete diffusion models. We conduct extensive experiments on the textless direct speech-to-speech translation task, where the proposed method achieves comparable results to the computationally intensive auto-regressive baselines (500 steps on average) with significantly fewer decoding steps (50 steps). |[2310.17570v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17570v1)|null|

Crucially, standard diffusion models rely on the well-established theory of score matching, but efforts to generalize this to discrete structures have not yielded the same empirical gains. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing score entropy, a novel discrete score matching loss that is more stable than existing methods, forms an ELBO for maximum likelihood training, and can be efficiently optimized with a denoising variant. We scale our Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models (SEDD) to the experimental setting of GPT-2, achieving highly competitive likelihoods while also introducing distinct algorithmic advantages. In particular, when comparing similarly sized SEDD and GPT-2 models, SEDD attains comparable perplexities (normally within $+10\%$ of and sometimes outperforming the baseline). Furthermore, SEDD models learn a more faithful sequence distribution (around $4\times$ better compared to GPT-2 models with ancestral sampling as measured by large models), can trade off compute for generation quality (needing only $16\times$ fewer network evaluations to match GPT-2), and enables arbitrary infilling beyond the standard left to right prompting. |[2310.16834v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16834v1)|null|

Without considering structure relationships between samples, previous methods generate noisy supervisory signals which cannot strike a balance between quantity and quality, hindering the formation of new intent clusters and effective transfer of the pre-training knowledge. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a novel Diffusion Weighted Graph Framework (DWGF) to capture both semantic similarities and structure relationships inherent in data, enabling more sufficient and reliable supervisory signals. Specifically, for each sample, we diffuse neighborhood relationships along semantic paths guided by the nearest neighbors for multiple hops to characterize its local structure discriminately. Then, we sample its positive keys and weigh them based on semantic similarities and local structures for contrastive learning. During inference, we further propose Graph Smoothing Filter (GSF) to explicitly utilize the structure relationships to filter high-frequency noise embodied in semantically ambiguous samples on the cluster boundary. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models on all evaluation metrics across multiple benchmark datasets. Code and data are available at https://github.com/yibai-shi/DWGF. |[2310.15836v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15836v1)|**[link](https://github.com/yibai-shi/dwgf)**|
|**2023-10-24**|**ScanDL: A Diffusion Model for Generating Synthetic Scanpaths on Texts**|cs.CL|Eye movements in reading play a crucial role in psycholinguistic research studying the cognitive mechanisms underlying human language processing. More recently, the tight coupling between eye movements and cognition has also been leveraged for language-related machine learning tasks such as the interpretability, enhancement, and pre-training of language models, as well as the inference of reader- and text-specific properties. However, scarcity of eye movement data and its unavailability at application time poses a major challenge for this line of research. Initially, this problem was tackled by resorting to cognitive models for synthesizing eye movement data. However, for the sole purpose of generating human-like scanpaths, purely data-driven machine-learning-based methods have proven to be more suitable. Following recent advances in adapting diffusion processes to discrete data, we propose ScanDL, a novel discrete sequence-to-sequence diffusion model that generates synthetic scanpaths on texts. By leveraging pre-trained word representations and jointly embedding both the stimulus text and the fixation sequence, our model captures multi-modal interactions between the two inputs. We evaluate ScanDL within- and across-dataset and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art scanpath generation methods. Finally, we provide an extensive psycholinguistic analysis that underlines the model's ability to exhibit human-like reading behavior. Our implementation is made available at https://github.com/DiLi-Lab/ScanDL. |[2310.15587v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15587v1)|**[link](https://github.com/dili-lab/scandl)**|
|**2023-10-23**|**DeTiME: Diffusion-Enhanced Topic Modeling using Encoder-decoder based LLM**|cs.CL, cs.AI, 68T50, I.2.7|In the burgeoning field of natural language processing, Neural Topic Models (NTMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as areas of significant research interest. Despite this, NTMs primarily utilize contextual embeddings from LLMs, which are not optimal for clustering or capable for topic generation. Our study addresses this gap by introducing a novel framework named Diffusion-Enhanced Topic Modeling using Encoder-Decoder-based LLMs (DeTiME). DeTiME leverages ncoder-Decoder-based LLMs to produce highly clusterable embeddings that could generate topics that exhibit both superior clusterability and enhanced semantic coherence compared to existing methods. Additionally, by exploiting the power of diffusion, our framework also provides the capability to generate content relevant to the identified topics. This dual functionality allows users to efficiently produce highly clustered topics and related content simultaneously. DeTiME's potential extends to generating clustered embeddings as well. Notably, our proposed framework proves to be efficient to train and exhibits high adaptability, demonstrating its potential for a wide array of applications. |[2310.15296v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15296v1)|null|
|**2023-10-18**|**InfoDiffusion: Information Entropy Aware Diffusion Process for Non-Autoregressive Text Generation**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Diffusion models have garnered considerable interest in the field of text generation. Several studies have explored text diffusion models with different structures and applied them to various tasks, including named entity recognition and summarization. However, there exists a notable disparity between the "easy-first" text generation process of current diffusion models and the "keyword-first" natural text generation process of humans, which has received limited attention. To bridge this gap, we propose InfoDiffusion, a non-autoregressive text diffusion model. Our approach introduces a "keyinfo-first" generation strategy and incorporates a noise schedule based on the amount of text information. In addition, InfoDiffusion combines self-conditioning with a newly proposed partially noising model structure. Experimental results show that InfoDiffusion outperforms the baseline model in terms of generation quality and diversity, as well as exhibiting higher sampling efficiency. |[2310.11976v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11976v1)|**[link](https://github.com/rzhwang/infodiffusion)**|

However, going beyond natural designs to discover proteins that meet specified mechanical properties remains challenging. Here we report a generative model that predicts protein designs to meet complex nonlinear mechanical property-design objectives. Our model leverages deep knowledge on protein sequences from a pre-trained protein language model and maps mechanical unfolding responses to create novel proteins. Via full-atom molecular simulations for direct validation, we demonstrate that the designed proteins are novel, and fulfill the targeted mechanical properties, including unfolding energy and mechanical strength, as well as the detailed unfolding force-separation curves. Our model offers rapid pathways to explore the enormous mechanobiological protein sequence space unconstrained by biological synthesis, using mechanical features as target to enable the discovery of protein materials with superior mechanical properties. |[2310.10605v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10605v1)|null|

Nevertheless, current approaches predominantly represent discrete text within a continuous diffusion space, which incurs substantial computational overhead during training and results in slower sampling speeds. In this paper, we introduce a soft absorbing state that facilitates the diffusion model in learning to reconstruct discrete mutations based on the underlying Gaussian space, thereby enhancing its capacity to recover conditional signals. During the sampling phase, we employ state-of-the-art ODE solvers within the continuous space to expedite the sampling process. Comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that our proposed method effectively accelerates the training convergence by 4x and generates samples of similar quality 800x faster, rendering it significantly closer to practical application. \footnote{The code is released at \url{https://github.com/Shark-NLP/DiffuSeq} |[2310.05793v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05793v2)|**[link](https://github.com/Shark-NLP/DiffuSeq)**|
|**2023-09-25**|**Multiple Noises in Diffusion Model for Semi-Supervised Multi-Domain Translation**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG|Domain-to-domain translation involves generating a target domain sample given a condition in the source domain. Most existing methods focus on fixed input and output domains, i.e. they only work for specific configurations (i.e. for two domains, either $D_1\rightarrow{}D_2$ or $D_2\rightarrow{}D_1$). This paper proposes Multi-Domain Diffusion (MDD), a conditional diffusion framework for multi-domain translation in a semi-supervised context. Unlike previous methods, MDD does not require defining input and output domains, allowing translation between any partition of domains within a set (such as $(D_1, D_2)\rightarrow{}D_3$, $D_2\rightarrow{}(D_1, D_3)$, $D_3\rightarrow{}D_1$, etc. for 3 domains), without the need to train separate models for each domain configuration. The key idea behind MDD is to leverage the noise formulation of diffusion models by incorporating one noise level per domain, which allows missing domains to be modeled with noise in a natural way. This transforms the training task from a simple reconstruction task to a domain translation task, where the model relies on less noisy domains to reconstruct more noisy domains. We present results on a multi-domain (with more than two domains) synthetic image translation dataset with challenging semantic domain inversion. |[2309.14394v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14394v1)|null|
|**2023-09-04**|**ParaGuide: Guided Diffusion Paraphrasers for Plug-and-Play Textual Style Transfer**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Textual style transfer is the task of transforming stylistic properties of text while preserving meaning. Target "styles" can be defined in numerous ways, ranging from single attributes (e.g, formality) to authorship (e.g, Shakespeare). Previous unsupervised style-transfer approaches generally rely on significant amounts of labeled data for only a fixed set of styles or require large language models. In contrast, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework for general-purpose style transfer that can be flexibly adapted to arbitrary target styles at inference time. Our parameter-efficient approach, ParaGuide, leverages paraphrase-conditioned diffusion models alongside gradient-based guidance from both off-the-shelf classifiers and strong existing style embedders to transform the style of text while preserving semantic information. We validate the method on the Enron Email Corpus, with both human and automatic evaluations, and find that it outperforms strong baselines on formality, sentiment, and even authorship style transfer. |[2308.15459v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15459v2)|**[link](https://github.com/zacharyhorvitz/ParaGuide)**|
|**2023-08-25**|**Diffusion Language Models Can Perform Many Tasks with Scaling and Instruction-Finetuning**|cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG|The recent surge of generative AI has been fueled by the generative power of diffusion probabilistic models and the scalable capabilities of large language models. Despite their potential, it remains elusive whether diffusion language models can solve general language tasks comparable to their autoregressive counterparts. This paper demonstrates that scaling diffusion models w.r.t. data, sizes, and tasks can effectively make them strong language learners. We build competent diffusion language models at scale by first acquiring knowledge from massive data via masked language modeling pretraining thanks to their intrinsic connections. We then reprogram pretrained masked language models into diffusion language models via diffusive adaptation, wherein task-specific finetuning and instruction finetuning are explored to unlock their versatility in solving general language tasks. Experiments show that scaling diffusion language models consistently improves performance across downstream language tasks. We further discover that instruction finetuning can elicit zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning abilities that help tackle many unseen tasks by following natural language instructions, and show promise in advanced and challenging abilities such as reasoning. |[2308.12219v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12219v2)|**[link](https://github.com/yegcjs/diffusionllm)**|
|**2023-08-17**|**Enhancing Phrase Representation by Information Bottleneck Guided Text Diffusion Process for Keyphrase Extraction**|cs.CL|Keyphrase extraction (KPE) is an important task in Natural Language Processing for many scenarios, which aims to extract keyphrases that are present in a given document. Many existing supervised methods treat KPE as sequential labeling, span-level classification, or generative tasks. However, these methods lack the ability to utilize keyphrase information, which may result in biased results. In this study, we propose Diff-KPE, which leverages the supervised Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to guide the text diffusion process for generating enhanced keyphrase representations. Diff-KPE first generates the desired keyphrase embeddings conditioned on the entire document and then injects the generated keyphrase embeddings into each phrase representation. A ranking network and VIB are then optimized together with rank loss and classification loss, respectively. This design of Diff-KPE allows us to rank each candidate phrase by utilizing both the information of keyphrases and the document. Experiments show that Diff-KPE outperforms existing KPE methods on a large open domain keyphrase extraction benchmark, OpenKP, and a scientific domain dataset, KP20K. |[2308.08739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08739v1)|null|
|**2023-07-26**|**Founding a mathematical diffusion model in linguistics. The case study of German syntactic features in the North-Eastern Italian dialects**|cs.CL|We take as a case study the spread of Germanic syntactic features into Romance dialects of North-Eastern Italy, which occurred after the immigration of German people in the Tyrol during the High Middle Ages.   An interactive map is produced using tools of what is called Geographic Data Science. A smooth two-dimensional surface $\mathcal{G}$ expresses locally which fraction of territory uses a given German language feature: it is obtained by interpolating a discrete function that says if at any surveyed locality that feature is used or not.\newline   This surface $\mathcal{G}$ is thought of as the value at the present time of a function describing a diffusion-convection phenomenon in two dimensions (here said \emph{tidal} mode), which is subjected in a very natural way to the same equation, suitably contextualized, used in physics for a number of phenomenological facts like the heat diffusion. It is shown that solutions of this equation, evaluated at the present time, fit well with the data as interpolated by $\mathcal{G}$, thus providing convincing pictures of diffusion-convection of the linguistic features of the case study, albeit simplifications and approximations.\newline   Very importantly, it is shown that Schmidt's 'waves' can be counted among the solutions of the diffusion equation: superimposing Schmidt 'waves' to a 'tidal flooding' can reproduce complexities of real linguistic diffusion events. |[2307.14291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14291v1)|null|
|**2023-07-26**|**How Does Diffusion Influence Pretrained Language Models on Out-of-Distribution Data?**|cs.CL, cs.AI|Transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs) have achieved great success in modern NLP. An important advantage of PLMs is good out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Recently, diffusion models have attracted a lot of work to apply diffusion to PLMs. It remains under-explored how diffusion influences PLMs on OOD data. The core of diffusion models is a forward diffusion process which gradually applies Gaussian noise to inputs, and a reverse denoising process which removes noise. The noised input reconstruction is a fundamental ability of diffusion models. We directly analyze OOD robustness by measuring the reconstruction loss, including testing the abilities to reconstruct OOD data, and to detect OOD samples. Experiments are conducted by analyzing different training parameters and data statistical features on eight datasets. It shows that finetuning PLMs with diffusion degrades the reconstruction ability on OOD data. The comparison also shows that diffusion models can effectively detect OOD samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance in most of the datasets with an absolute accuracy improvement up to 18%. These results indicate that diffusion reduces OOD robustness of PLMs. |[2307.13949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13949v1)|**[link](https://github.com/maybelizzy/diffusion_ood_robustness)**|

However, the application of diffusion models in a cross-lingual setting is less unexplored. Additionally, while pretraining with diffusion models has been studied within a single language, the potential of cross-lingual pretraining remains understudied. To address these gaps, we propose XDLM, a novel Cross-lingual diffusion model for machine translation, consisting of pretraining and fine-tuning stages. In the pretraining stage, we propose TLDM, a new training objective for mastering the mapping between different languages; in the fine-tuning stage, we build up the translation system based on the pretrained model. We evaluate the result on several machine translation benchmarks and outperformed both diffusion and Transformer baselines. |[2307.13560v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13560v2)|null|
|**2023-06-14**|**DiffuDetox: A Mixed Diffusion Model for Text Detoxification**|cs.CL, cs.LG|Text detoxification is a conditional text generation task aiming to remove offensive content from toxic text. It is highly useful for online forums and social media, where offensive content is frequently encountered. Intuitively, there are diverse ways to detoxify sentences while preserving their meanings, and we can select from detoxified sentences before displaying text to users. Conditional diffusion models are particularly suitable for this task given their demonstrated higher generative diversity than existing conditional text generation models based on language models. Nonetheless, text fluency declines when they are trained with insufficient data, which is the case for this task. In this work, we propose DiffuDetox, a mixed conditional and unconditional diffusion model for text detoxification. The conditional model takes toxic text as the condition and reduces its toxicity, yielding a diverse set of detoxified sentences. The unconditional model is trained to recover the input text, which allows the introduction of additional fluent text for training and thus ensures text fluency. Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DiffuDetox. |[2306.08505v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08505v1)|null|
|**2023-06-05**|**PLANNER: Generating Diversified Paragraph via Latent Language Diffusion Model**|cs.CL|Autoregressive models for text sometimes generate repetitive and low-quality output because errors accumulate during the steps of generation. This issue is often attributed to exposure bias - the difference between how a model is trained, and how it is used during inference. Denoising diffusion models provide an alternative approach in which a model can revisit and revise its output. However, they can be computationally expensive and prior efforts on text have led to models that produce less fluent output compared to autoregressive models, especially for longer text and paragraphs. In this paper, we propose PLANNER, a model that combines latent semantic diffusion with autoregressive generation, to generate fluent text while exercising global control over paragraphs. The model achieves this by combining an autoregressive "decoding" module with a "planning" module that uses latent diffusion to generate semantic paragraph embeddings in a coarse-to-fine manner. The proposed method is evaluated on various conditional generation tasks, and results on semantic generation, text completion and summarization show its effectiveness in generating high-quality long-form text in an efficient manner. |[2306.02531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02531v1)|null|

Though several methods have been proposed to generate empathetic responses, existing works often lead to monotonous empathy that refers to generic and safe expressions. In this paper, we propose to use explicit control to guide the empathy expression and design a framework DiffusEmp based on conditional diffusion language model to unify the utilization of dialogue context and attribute-oriented control signals. Specifically, communication mechanism, intent, and semantic frame are imported as multi-grained signals that control the empathy realization from coarse to fine levels. We then design a specific masking strategy to reflect the relationship between multi-grained signals and response tokens, and integrate it into the diffusion model to influence the generative process. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset EmpatheticDialogue show that our framework outperforms competitive baselines in terms of controllability, informativeness, and diversity without the loss of context-relatedness. |[2306.01657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01657v1)|null|

Previous works on diffusion-based language models have shown that they can be trained without external knowledge (such as pre-trained weights) and still achieve stable performance and controllability. In this paper, we trained a diffusion-based model on StylePTB dataset, the standard benchmark for fine-grained text style transfers. The tasks in StylePTB requires much more refined control over the output text compared to tasks evaluated in previous works, and our model was able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on StylePTB on both individual and compositional transfers. Moreover, our model, trained on limited data from StylePTB without external knowledge, outperforms previous works that utilized pretrained weights, embeddings, and external grammar parsers, and this may indicate that diffusion-based language models have great potential under low-resource settings. |[2305.19512v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19512v1)|**[link](https://github.com/lvyiwei1/diffuseq_styleptb)**|

In this work, we take the first steps towards closing the likelihood gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based language models, with the goal of building and releasing a diffusion model which outperforms a small but widely-known autoregressive model. We pursue this goal through algorithmic improvements, scaling laws, and increased compute. On the algorithmic front, we introduce several methodological improvements for the maximum-likelihood training of diffusion language models. We then study scaling laws for our diffusion models and find compute-optimal training regimes which differ substantially from autoregressive models. Using our methods and scaling analysis, we train and release Plaid 1B, a large diffusion language model which outperforms GPT-2 124M in likelihood on benchmark datasets and generates fluent samples in unconditional and zero-shot control settings. |[2305.18619v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18619v1)|**[link](https://github.com/igul222/plaid)**|
