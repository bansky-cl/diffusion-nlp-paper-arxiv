This issue is often attributed to exposure bias - the difference between how a model is trained, and how it is used during inference. Denoising diffusion models provide an alternative approach in which a model can revisit and revise its output. However, they can be computationally expensive and prior efforts on text have led to models that produce less fluent output compared to autoregressive models, especially for longer text and paragraphs. In this paper, we propose PLANNER, a model that combines latent semantic diffusion with autoregressive generation, to generate fluent text while exercising global control over paragraphs. The model achieves this by combining an autoregressive \"decoding\" module with a \"planning\" module that uses latent diffusion to generate semantic paragraph embeddings in a coarse-to-fine manner. The proposed method is evaluated on various conditional generation tasks, and results on semantic generation, text completion and summarization show its effectiveness in generating high-quality long-form text in an efficient manner. |[2306.02531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02531v1)|null|\n",

Though several methods have been proposed to generate empathetic responses, existing works often lead to monotonous empathy that refers to generic and safe expressions. In this paper, we propose to use explicit control to guide the empathy expression and design a framework DiffusEmp based on conditional diffusion language model to unify the utilization of dialogue context and attribute-oriented control signals. Specifically, communication mechanism, intent, and semantic frame are imported as multi-grained signals that control the empathy realization from coarse to fine levels. We then design a specific masking strategy to reflect the relationship between multi-grained signals and response tokens, and integrate it into the diffusion model to influence the generative process. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset EmpatheticDialogue show that our framework outperforms competitive baselines in terms of controllability, informativeness, and diversity without the loss of context-relatedness. |[2306.01657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01657v1)|null|\n",

Previous works on diffusion-based language models have shown that they can be trained without external knowledge (such as pre-trained weights) and still achieve stable performance and controllability. In this paper, we trained a diffusion-based model on StylePTB dataset, the standard benchmark for fine-grained text style transfers. The tasks in StylePTB requires much more refined control over the output text compared to tasks evaluated in previous works, and our model was able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on StylePTB on both individual and compositional transfers. Moreover, our model, trained on limited data from StylePTB without external knowledge, outperforms previous works that utilized pretrained weights, embeddings, and external grammar parsers, and this may indicate that diffusion-based language models have great potential under low-resource settings. |[2305.19512v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19512v1)|**[link](https://github.com/lvyiwei1/diffuseq_styleptb)**|\n",

In this work, we take the first steps towards closing the likelihood gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based language models, with the goal of building and releasing a diffusion model which outperforms a small but widely-known autoregressive model. We pursue this goal through algorithmic improvements, scaling laws, and increased compute. On the algorithmic front, we introduce several methodological improvements for the maximum-likelihood training of diffusion language models. We then study scaling laws for our diffusion models and find compute-optimal training regimes which differ substantially from autoregressive models. Using our methods and scaling analysis, we train and release Plaid 1B, a large diffusion language model which outperforms GPT-2 124M in likelihood on benchmark datasets and generates fluent samples in unconditional and zero-shot control settings. |[2305.18619v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18619v1)|**[link](https://github.com/igul222/plaid)**|\n",

It is highly useful for online forums and social media, where offensive content is frequently encountered. Intuitively, there are diverse ways to detoxify sentences while preserving their meanings, and we can select from detoxified sentences before displaying text to users. Conditional diffusion models are particularly suitable for this task given their demonstrated higher generative diversity than existing conditional text generation models based on language models. Nonetheless, text fluency declines when they are trained with insufficient data, which is the case for this task. In this work, we propose DiffuDetox, a mixed conditional and unconditional diffusion model for text detoxification. The conditional model takes toxic text as the condition and reduces its toxicity, yielding a diverse set of detoxified sentences. The unconditional model is trained to recover the input text, which allows the introduction of additional fluent text for training and thus ensures text fluency. Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DiffuDetox. |[2306.08505v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08505v1)|null|\n",

However, the application of diffusion models in a cross-lingual setting is less unexplored. Additionally, while pretraining with diffusion models has been studied within a single language, the potential of cross-lingual pretraining remains understudied. To address these gaps, we propose XDLM, a novel Cross-lingual diffusion model for machine translation, consisting of pretraining and fine-tuning stages. In the pretraining stage, we propose TLDM, a new training objective for mastering the mapping between different languages; in the fine-tuning stage, we build up the translation system based on the pretrained model. We evaluate the result on several machine translation benchmarks and outperformed both diffusion and Transformer baselines. |[2307.13560v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13560v2)|null|\n",

An interactive map is produced using tools of what is called Geographic Data Science. A smooth two-dimensional surface $\\mathcal{G}$ expresses locally which fraction of territory uses a given German language feature: it is obtained by interpolating a discrete function that says if at any surveyed locality that feature is used or not.\\newline   This surface $\\mathcal{G}$ is thought of as the value at the present time of a function describing a diffusion-convection phenomenon in two dimensions (here said \\emph{tidal} mode), which is subjected in a very natural way to the same equation, suitably contextualized, used in physics for a number of phenomenological facts like the heat diffusion. It is shown that solutions of this equation, evaluated at the present time, fit well with the data as interpolated by $\\mathcal{G}$, thus providing convincing pictures of diffusion-convection of the linguistic features of the case study, albeit simplifications and approximations.\\newline   Very importantly, it is shown that Schmidt's 'waves' can be counted among the solutions of the diffusion equation: superimposing Schmidt 'waves' to a 'tidal flooding' can reproduce complexities of real linguistic diffusion events. |[2307.14291v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14291v1)|null|\n",

An important advantage of PLMs is good out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Recently, diffusion models have attracted a lot of work to apply diffusion to PLMs. It remains under-explored how diffusion influences PLMs on OOD data. The core of diffusion models is a forward diffusion process which gradually applies Gaussian noise to inputs, and a reverse denoising process which removes noise. The noised input reconstruction is a fundamental ability of diffusion models. We directly analyze OOD robustness by measuring the reconstruction loss, including testing the abilities to reconstruct OOD data, and to detect OOD samples. Experiments are conducted by analyzing different training parameters and data statistical features on eight datasets. It shows that finetuning PLMs with diffusion degrades the reconstruction ability on OOD data. The comparison also shows that diffusion models can effectively detect OOD samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance in most of the datasets with an absolute accuracy improvement up to 18%. These results indicate that diffusion reduces OOD robustness of PLMs. |[2307.13949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13949v1)|**[link](https://github.com/maybelizzy/diffusion_ood_robustness)**|\n",

Many existing supervised methods treat KPE as sequential labeling, span-level classification, or generative tasks. However, these methods lack the ability to utilize keyphrase information, which may result in biased results. In this study, we propose Diff-KPE, which leverages the supervised Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to guide the text diffusion process for generating enhanced keyphrase representations. Diff-KPE first generates the desired keyphrase embeddings conditioned on the entire document and then injects the generated keyphrase embeddings into each phrase representation. A ranking network and VIB are then optimized together with rank loss and classification loss, respectively. This design of Diff-KPE allows us to rank each candidate phrase by utilizing both the information of keyphrases and the document. Experiments show that Diff-KPE outperforms existing KPE methods on a large open domain keyphrase extraction benchmark, OpenKP, and a scientific domain dataset, KP20K. |[2308.08739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08739v1)|null|\n",

Despite their potential, it remains elusive whether diffusion language models can solve general language tasks comparable to their autoregressive counterparts. This paper demonstrates that scaling diffusion models w.r.t. data, sizes, and tasks can effectively make them strong language learners. We build competent diffusion language models at scale by first acquiring knowledge from massive data via masked language modeling pretraining thanks to their intrinsic connections. We then reprogram pretrained masked language models into diffusion language models via diffusive adaptation, wherein task-specific finetuning and instruction finetuning are explored to unlock their versatility in solving general language tasks. Experiments show that scaling diffusion language models consistently improves performance across downstream language tasks. We further discover that instruction finetuning can elicit zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning abilities that help tackle many unseen tasks by following natural language instructions, and show promise in advanced and challenging abilities such as reasoning. |[2308.12219v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12219v2)|**[link](https://github.com/yegcjs/diffusionllm)**|\n",

Target \"styles\" can be defined in numerous ways, ranging from single attributes (e.g, formality) to authorship (e.g, Shakespeare). Previous unsupervised style-transfer approaches generally rely on significant amounts of labeled data for only a fixed set of styles or require large language models. In contrast, we introduce a novel diffusion-based framework for general-purpose style transfer that can be flexibly adapted to arbitrary target styles at inference time. Our parameter-efficient approach, ParaGuide, leverages paraphrase-conditioned diffusion models alongside gradient-based guidance from both off-the-shelf classifiers and strong existing style embedders to transform the style of text while preserving semantic information. We validate the method on the Enron Email Corpus, with both human and automatic evaluations, and find that it outperforms strong baselines on formality, sentiment, and even authorship style transfer. |[2308.15459v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15459v2)|**[link](https://github.com/zacharyhorvitz/ParaGuide)**|\n",

Most existing methods focus on fixed input and output domains, i.e. they only work for specific configurations (i.e. for two domains, either $D_1\\rightarrow{}D_2$ or $D_2\\rightarrow{}D_1$). This paper proposes Multi-Domain Diffusion (MDD), a conditional diffusion framework for multi-domain translation in a semi-supervised context. Unlike previous methods, MDD does not require defining input and output domains, allowing translation between any partition of domains within a set (such as $(D_1, D_2)\\rightarrow{}D_3$, $D_2\\rightarrow{}(D_1, D_3)$, $D_3\\rightarrow{}D_1$, etc. for 3 domains), without the need to train separate models for each domain configuration. The key idea behind MDD is to leverage the noise formulation of diffusion models by incorporating one noise level per domain, which allows missing domains to be modeled with noise in a natural way. This transforms the training task from a simple reconstruction task to a domain translation task, where the model relies on less noisy domains to reconstruct more noisy domains. We present results on a multi-domain (with more than two domains) synthetic image translation dataset with challenging semantic domain inversion. |[2309.14394v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14394v1)|null|\n",

During the sampling phase, we employ state-of-the-art ODE solvers within the continuous space to expedite the sampling process. Comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that our proposed method effectively accelerates the training convergence by 4x and generates samples of similar quality 800x faster, rendering it significantly closer to practical application. \\footnote{The code is released at \\url{https://github.com/Shark-NLP/DiffuSeq} |[2310.05793v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05793v1)|null|\n"
