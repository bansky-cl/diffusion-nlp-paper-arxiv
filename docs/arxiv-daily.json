This issue is often attributed to exposure bias - the difference between how a model is trained, and how it is used during inference. Denoising diffusion models provide an alternative approach in which a model can revisit and revise its output. However, they can be computationally expensive and prior efforts on text have led to models that produce less fluent output compared to autoregressive models, especially for longer text and paragraphs. In this paper, we propose PLANNER, a model that combines latent semantic diffusion with autoregressive generation, to generate fluent text while exercising global control over paragraphs. The model achieves this by combining an autoregressive \"decoding\" module with a \"planning\" module that uses latent diffusion to generate semantic paragraph embeddings in a coarse-to-fine manner. The proposed method is evaluated on various conditional generation tasks, and results on semantic generation, text completion and summarization show its effectiveness in generating high-quality long-form text in an efficient manner.</details>|[2306.02531v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02531v1)|null|",

Though several methods have been proposed to generate empathetic responses, existing works often lead to monotonous empathy that refers to generic and safe expressions. In this paper, we propose to use explicit control to guide the empathy expression and design a framework DiffusEmp based on conditional diffusion language model to unify the utilization of dialogue context and attribute-oriented control signals. Specifically, communication mechanism, intent, and semantic frame are imported as multi-grained signals that control the empathy realization from coarse to fine levels. We then design a specific masking strategy to reflect the relationship between multi-grained signals and response tokens, and integrate it into the diffusion model to influence the generative process. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset EmpatheticDialogue show that our framework outperforms competitive baselines in terms of controllability, informativeness, and diversity without the loss of context-relatedness.</details>|[2306.01657v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01657v1)|null|",

Previous works on diffusion-based language models have shown that they can be trained without external knowledge (such as pre-trained weights) and still achieve stable performance and controllability. In this paper, we trained a diffusion-based model on StylePTB dataset, the standard benchmark for fine-grained text style transfers. The tasks in StylePTB requires much more refined control over the output text compared to tasks evaluated in previous works, and our model was able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on StylePTB on both individual and compositional transfers. Moreover, our model, trained on limited data from StylePTB without external knowledge, outperforms previous works that utilized pretrained weights, embeddings, and external grammar parsers, and this may indicate that diffusion-based language models have great potential under low-resource settings.</details>|[2305.19512v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19512v1)|**[link](https://github.com/lvyiwei1/diffuseq_styleptb)**|",

It is highly useful for online forums and social media, where offensive content is frequently encountered. Intuitively, there are diverse ways to detoxify sentences while preserving their meanings, and we can select from detoxified sentences before displaying text to users. Conditional diffusion models are particularly suitable for this task given their demonstrated higher generative diversity than existing conditional text generation models based on language models. Nonetheless, text fluency declines when they are trained with insufficient data, which is the case for this task. In this work, we propose DiffuDetox, a mixed conditional and unconditional diffusion model for text detoxification. The conditional model takes toxic text as the condition and reduces its toxicity, yielding a diverse set of detoxified sentences. The unconditional model is trained to recover the input text, which allows the introduction of additional fluent text for training and thus ensures text fluency.

An important advantage of PLMs is good out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Recently, diffusion models have attracted a lot of work to apply diffusion to PLMs. It remains under-explored how diffusion influences PLMs on OOD data. The core of diffusion models is a forward diffusion process which gradually applies Gaussian noise to inputs, and a reverse denoising process which removes noise. The noised input reconstruction is a fundamental ability of diffusion models. We directly analyze OOD robustness by measuring the reconstruction loss, including testing the abilities to reconstruct OOD data, and to detect OOD samples. Experiments are conducted by analyzing different training parameters and data statistical features on eight datasets. It shows that finetuning PLMs with diffusion degrades the reconstruction ability on OOD data. The comparison also shows that diffusion models can effectively detect OOD samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance in most of the datasets with an absolute accuracy improvement up to 18%. These results indicate that diffusion reduces OOD robustness of PLMs.</details>|[2307.13949v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13949v1)|**[link](https://github.com/maybelizzy/diffusion_ood_robustness)**|",

Many existing supervised methods treat KPE as sequential labeling, span-level classification, or generative tasks. However, these methods lack the ability to utilize keyphrase information, which may result in biased results. In this study, we propose Diff-KPE, which leverages the supervised Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to guide the text diffusion process for generating enhanced keyphrase representations. Diff-KPE first generates the desired keyphrase embeddings conditioned on the entire document and then injects the generated keyphrase embeddings into each phrase representation. A ranking network and VIB are then optimized together with rank loss and classification loss, respectively. This design of Diff-KPE allows us to rank each candidate phrase by utilizing both the information of keyphrases and the document. Experiments show that Diff-KPE outperforms existing KPE methods on a large open domain keyphrase extraction benchmark, OpenKP, and a scientific domain dataset, KP20K.</details>|[2308.08739v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08739v1)|null|",

Most existing methods focus on fixed input and output domains, i.e. they only work for specific configurations (i.e. for two domains, either $D_1\\rightarrow{}D_2$ or $D_2\\rightarrow{}D_1$). This paper proposes Multi-Domain Diffusion (MDD), a conditional diffusion framework for multi-domain translation in a semi-supervised context. Unlike previous methods, MDD does not require defining input and output domains, allowing translation between any partition of domains within a set (such as $(D_1, D_2)\\rightarrow{}D_3$, $D_2\\rightarrow{}(D_1, D_3)$, $D_3\\rightarrow{}D_1$, etc. for 3 domains), without the need to train separate models for each domain configuration. The key idea behind MDD is to leverage the noise formulation of diffusion models by incorporating one noise level per domain, which allows missing domains to be modeled with noise in a natural way. This transforms the training task from a simple reconstruction task to a domain translation task, where the model relies on less noisy domains to reconstruct more noisy domains. We present results on a multi-domain (with more than two domains) synthetic image translation dataset with challenging semantic domain inversion.</details>|[2309.14394v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14394v1)|null|",

More recently, the tight coupling between eye movements and cognition has also been leveraged for language-related machine learning tasks such as the interpretability, enhancement, and pre-training of language models, as well as the inference of reader- and text-specific properties. However, scarcity of eye movement data and its unavailability at application time poses a major challenge for this line of research.

Existing works alleviate this problem by equipping language models with defense patches. However, these defense strategies often rely on impractical assumptions or entail substantial sacrifices in model performance. Consequently, enhancing the resilience of the target model using such defense mechanisms is a formidable challenge. This paper introduces an innovative model for robust text inference and classification, built upon diffusion models (ROIC-DM). Benefiting from its training involving denoising stages, ROIC-DM inherently exhibits greater robustness compared to conventional language models. Moreover, ROIC-DM can attain comparable, and in some cases, superior performance to language models, by effectively incorporating them as advisory components. Extensive experiments conducted with several strong textual adversarial attacks on three datasets demonstrate that (1) ROIC-DM outperforms traditional language models in robustness, even when the latter are fortified with advanced defense mechanisms; (2) ROIC-DM can achieve comparable and even better performance than traditional language models by using them as advisors.</details>|[2401.03514v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03514v2)|null|",

We are particularly interested to see whether pretrained AR models can be transformed into text diffusion models through a lightweight adaptation procedure we call ``AR2Diff''. We begin by establishing a strong baseline setup for training text diffusion models. Comparing across multiple architectures and pretraining objectives, we find that training a decoder-only model with a prefix LM objective is best or near-best across several tasks. Building on this finding, we test various transfer learning setups for text diffusion models. On machine translation, we find that text diffusion underperforms the standard AR approach. However, on code synthesis and extractive QA, we find diffusion models trained from scratch outperform AR models in many cases. We also observe quality gains from AR2Diff -- adapting AR models to use diffusion decoding. These results are promising given that text diffusion is relatively underexplored and can be significantly faster than AR decoding for long text generation.</details>|[2401.17181v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17181v1)|null|",

Reward-gradient guided denoising has been recently proposed to generate trajectories that maximize both a differentiable reward function and the likelihood under the data distribution captured by a diffusion model. Reward-gradient guided denoising requires a differentiable reward function fitted to both clean and noised samples, limiting its applicability as a general trajectory optimizer. In this paper, we propose DiffusionES, a method that combines gradient-free optimization with trajectory denoising to optimize black-box non-differentiable objectives while staying in the data manifold. Diffusion-ES samples trajectories during evolutionary search from a diffusion model and scores them using a black-box reward function. It mutates high-scoring trajectories using a truncated diffusion process that applies a small number of noising and denoising steps, allowing for much more efficient exploration of the solution space. We show that DiffusionES achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuPlan, an established closed-loop planning benchmark for autonomous driving. Diffusion-ES outperforms existing sampling-based planners, reactive deterministic or diffusion-based policies, and reward-gradient guidance. Additionally, we show that unlike prior guidance methods, our method can optimize non-differentiable language-shaped reward functions generated by few-shot LLM prompting. When guided by a human teacher that issues instructions to follow, our method can generate novel, highly complex behaviors, such as aggressive lane weaving, which are not present in the training data. This allows us to solve the hardest nuPlan scenarios which are beyond the capabilities of existing trajectory optimization methods and driving policies.</details>|[2402.06559v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06559v1)|null|",

In contrast to autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT allows reasoning steps to diffuse over time through a diffusion language model and offers greater flexibility in trading-off computation for reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication, boolean logic, and grade school math problems, with a small diffusion model outperforming a much larger autoregressive model in both efficiency and accuracy. In addition to that, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding.

While recent research has shown significant success in complex text generation with language models, the memory and computational power are still very demanding and fall short of expectations, which naturally results in low portability and instability for the models. To mitigate these issues, numerous well-established methods were proposed for neural network quantization. To further enhance their portability of independent deployment as well as improve their stability evaluated by language perplexity, we propose a novel approach called the Quantized Embedding Controllable Diffusion Language Model (QE-CDLM). QE-CDLM builds upon the recent successful controllable DLMs by remodeling the task-specific embedding space via quantization. This leads to a gradient-based controller for the generation tasks, and more stable intermediate latent variables are obtained, which naturally brings in an accelerated convergence as well as better controllability. Additionally, the adaption fine-tuning method is employed to reduce tunable weights. Experimental results on five challenging fine-grained control tasks demonstrate that QE-CDLM compares favorably to existing methods in terms of quality and feasibility, achieving better perplexity and lightweight fine-tuning.</details>|[2402.10107v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10107v1)|null|",

However, this is a very relevant topic, especially if users have had no direct contact with Europe and its perception depends solely on information retrieved online. In this work we analyse the information circulating online about Europe and migration after retrieving a large amount of data from social media (Twitter), to gain new insights into topics, magnitude, and dynamics of their diffusion. We combine retweets and hashtags network analysis with geolocation of users, linking thus data to geography and allowing analysis from an \"outside Europe\" perspective, with a special focus on Africa. We also introduce a novel approach based on cross-lingual quotes, i.e. when content in a language is commented and retweeted in another language, assuming these interactions are a proxy for connections between very distant communities. Results show how the majority of online discussions occurs at a national level, especially when discussing migration. Language (English) is pivotal for information to become transnational and reach far. Transnational information flow is strongly unbalanced, with content mainly produced in Europe and amplified outside. Conversely Europe-based accounts tend to be self-referential when they discuss migration-related topics. Football is the most exported topic from Europe worldwide.

The key quantities to be estimated are the ratios between the marginal probabilities of two transitive states at all timesteps, called the concrete score. In this paper, we reveal that the concrete score in absorbing diffusion can be expressed as conditional probabilities of clean data, multiplied by a time-dependent scalar in an analytic form. Motivated by this finding, we propose reparameterized absorbing discrete diffusion (RADD), a dedicated diffusion model without time-condition that characterizes the time-independent conditional probabilities. Besides its simplicity, RADD can reduce the number of function evaluations (NFEs) by caching the output of the time-independent network when the noisy sample remains unchanged in a sampling interval. Empirically, RADD is up to 3.5 times faster while achieving similar performance with the strongest baseline. Built upon the new perspective of conditional distributions, we further unify absorbing discrete diffusion and any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs), showing that the upper bound on the negative log-likelihood for the diffusion model can be interpreted as an expected negative log-likelihood for AO-ARMs. Further, our RADD models achieve SOTA performance among diffusion models on 5 zero-shot language modeling benchmarks (measured by perplexity) at the GPT-2 scale.

In order to move towards a more integrated view of cascades, this paper offers the first comprehensive investigation into the role of two social factors in the diffusion of 1,337 popular hashtags representing the production of novel culture on Twitter: 1) the topology of the Twitter social network and 2) performance of each user's probable demographic identity. Here, we show that cascades are best modeled using a combination of network and identity, rather than either factor alone. This combined model best reproduces a composite index of ten cascade properties across all 1,337 hashtags. However, there is important heterogeneity in what social factors are required to reproduce different properties of hashtag cascades. For instance, while a combined network+identity model best predicts the popularity of cascades, a network-only model has better performance in predicting cascade growth and an identity-only model in adopter composition. We are able to predict what type of hashtag is best modeled by each combination of features and use this to further improve performance. Additionally, consistent with prior literature on the combined network+identity model most outperforms the single-factor counterfactuals among hashtags used for expressing racial or regional identity, stance-taking, talking about sports, or variants of existing cultural trends with very slow- or fast-growing communicative need.

Taking the generation of a combination of two disentangled concepts as an example, say given the prompt \"a tea cup of iced coke\", existing models usually generate a glass cup of iced coke because the iced coke usually co-occurs with the glass cup instead of the tea one during model training. The root of such misalignment is attributed to the confusion in the latent semantic space of text-to-image diffusion models, and hence we refer to the \"a tea cup of iced coke\" phenomenon as Latent Concept Misalignment (LC-Mis).

However, for many applications it is desirable to control attributes, such as sentiment, or toxicity, of the generated language -- ideally tailored towards each specific use case and target audience. For auto-regressive language models, existing guidance methods are prone to decoding errors that cascade during generation and degrade performance. In contrast, text diffusion models can easily be guided with, for example, a simple linear sentiment classifier -- however they do suffer from significantly higher perplexity than auto-regressive alternatives. In this paper we use a guided diffusion model to produce a latent proposal that steers an auto-regressive language model to generate text with desired properties. Our model inherits the unmatched fluency of the auto-regressive approach and the plug-and-play flexibility of diffusion. We show that it outperforms previous plug-and-play guidance methods across a wide range of benchmark data sets. Further, controlling a new attribute in our framework is reduced to training a single logistic regression classifier.</details>|[2408.04220v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04220v1)|**[link](https://github.com/justinlovelace/diffusion-guided-lm)**|",

While this technique has facilitated notable speed improvements by enabling parallel sequence verification, its efficiency remains inherently limited by the reliance on incremental token generation in existing draft models. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an adaptation of speculative decoding which uses discrete diffusion models to generate draft sequences. This allows parallelization of both the drafting and verification steps, providing significant speedups to the inference process. Our proposed approach, $\\textit{Speculative Diffusion Decoding (SpecDiff)}$, is validated on standard language generation benchmarks and empirically demonstrated to provide up to 7.2x speedups over standard generation processes and up to 1.75x speedups over existing speculative decoding approaches.</details>|[2408.05636v4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05636v4)|null|",

The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</details>|[2409.02908v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02908v3)|null|",

The potential of the diffusion language model (LM) for textual data augmentation (DA) remains unexplored, moreover, textual DA methods struggle to balance the diversity and consistency of new samples. Most DA methods either perform logical modifications or rephrase less important tokens in the original sequence with the language model. In the context of SC, strong emotional tokens could act critically on the sentiment of the whole sequence. Therefore, contrary to rephrasing less important context, we propose DiffusionCLS to leverage a diffusion LM to capture in-domain knowledge and generate pseudo samples by reconstructing strong label-related tokens. This approach ensures a balance between consistency and diversity, avoiding the introduction of noise and augmenting crucial features of datasets. DiffusionCLS also comprises a Noise-Resistant Training objective to help the model generalize. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various low-resource scenarios including domain-specific and domain-general problems.

Computational frameworks have been developed to capture the complex relationship between microstructure and material behavior. However, despite these advancements, the steep learning curve associated with domain-specific knowledge and complex algorithms restricts the broader application of these tools. To lower this barrier, we propose a framework that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to enable microstructure design using intuitive natural language commands. Our framework employs contextual data augmentation, driven by a pretrained LLM, to generate and expand a diverse dataset of microstructure descriptors. A retrained NER model extracts relevant microstructure descriptors from user-provided natural language inputs, which are then used by the DDPM to generate microstructures with targeted mechanical properties and topological features. The NLP and DDPM components of the framework are modular, allowing for separate training and validation, which ensures flexibility in adapting the framework to different datasets and use cases. A surrogate model system is employed to rank and filter generated samples based on their alignment with target properties.

Our key observation is that diffusion models demonstrate the balance between quality and diversity while auto-regressive text-to-text models are not successful at handling both at the same time. Furthermore, we found out that to achieve the highest quality possible, it is preferable to use a regular sampler with the strictest length constraint to create multiple samples, and then use MBR to aggregate the predictions.

It has been adapted for sequence-to-sequence text generation (Seq2Seq) through DiffuSeq, termed S2S Diffusion. Existing S2S-Diffusion models predominantly rely on fixed or hand-crafted rules to schedule noise during the diffusion and denoising processes. However, these models are limited by non-contextualized noise, which fails to fully consider the characteristics of Seq2Seq tasks.

We employ Meta-Exploration to train an additional scheduler model dedicated to scheduling contextualized noise for each sentence. Our exploiter model, an S2S-Diffusion model, leverages the noise scheduled by our scheduler model for updating and generation. Meta-DiffuB achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous S2S-Diffusion models and fine-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) across four Seq2Seq benchmark datasets.

This paper establishes the first scaling law for MDMs, demonstrating a scaling rate comparable to autoregressive models (ARMs) and a relatively small compute gap. Motivated by their scalability, we train a family of MDMs with up to 1.1 billion (B) parameters to systematically evaluate their performance against ARMs of comparable or larger sizes. Fully leveraging the probabilistic formulation of MDMs, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised classifier-free guidance that effectively exploits large-scale unpaired data, boosting performance for conditional inference.

As LLMs become more powerful, studying jailbreak methods is critical to enhancing security and aligning models with human values. Traditionally, jailbreak techniques have relied on suffix addition or prompt templates, but these methods suffer from limited attack diversity. This paper introduces DiffusionAttacker, an end-to-end generative approach for jailbreak rewriting inspired by diffusion models. Our method employs a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) text diffusion model as a generator, conditioning on the original prompt and guiding the denoising process with a novel attack loss. Unlike previous approaches that use autoregressive LLMs to generate jailbreak prompts, which limit the modification of already generated tokens and restrict the rewriting space, DiffusionAttacker utilizes a seq2seq diffusion model, allowing more flexible token modifications. This approach preserves the semantic content of the original prompt while producing harmful content. Additionally, we leverage the Gumbel-Softmax technique to make the sampling process from the diffusion model's output distribution differentiable, eliminating the need for iterative token search.

Recent fine-tuning methods typically align the prediction distributions of unsafe prompts with those of predefined text anchors. However, these techniques exhibit a considerable performance trade-off between eliminating undesirable concepts and preserving other concepts. In this paper, we systematically analyze the impact of diverse text anchors on unlearning performance. Guided by this analysis, we propose AdvAnchor, a novel approach that generates adversarial anchors to alleviate the trade-off issue. These adversarial anchors are crafted to closely resemble the embeddings of undesirable concepts to maintain overall model performance, while selectively excluding defining attributes of these concepts for effective erasure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdvAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

One would naturally expect this method to be an efficient replacement for autoregressive models since multiple tokens can be sampled in parallel during each diffusion step. However, its efficiency-accuracy trade-off is not yet well understood. In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of a widely used type of diffusion language model, the Masked Diffusion Model (MDM), and find that its effectiveness heavily depends on the target evaluation metric. Under mild conditions, we prove that when using perplexity as the metric, MDMs can achieve near-optimal perplexity in sampling steps regardless of sequence length, demonstrating that efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing performance. However, when using the sequence error rate--which is important for understanding the \"correctness\" of a sequence, such as a reasoning chain--we show that the required sampling steps must scale linearly with sequence length to obtain \"correct\" sequences, thereby eliminating MDM's efficiency advantage over autoregressive models. Our analysis establishes the first theoretical foundation for understanding the benefits and limitations of MDMs. All theoretical findings are supported by empirical studies.</details>|[2502.09622v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09622v1)|null|",

This challenge arises primarily from two aspects: firstly, the capabilities of existing models in text generation are limited; secondly, embedding algorithms fail to effectively mitigate the negative impacts of sensitive information's properties, such as semantic content or randomness. Specifically, to ensure that the recipient can accurately extract hidden information, embedding algorithms often have to consider selecting candidate words with relatively low probabilities. This phenomenon leads to a decrease in the number of high-probability candidate words and an increase in low-probability candidate words, thereby compromising the semantic coherence and logical fluency of the steganographic text and diminishing the overall quality of the generated steganographic material. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel embedding algorithm, character-based diffusion embedding algorithm (CDEA). Unlike existing embedding algorithms that strive to eliminate the impact of sensitive information's properties on the generation process, CDEA leverages sensitive information's properties. It enhances the selection frequency of high-probability candidate words in the candidate pool based on general statistical properties at the character level and grouping methods based on power-law distributions, while reducing the selection frequency of low-probability candidate words in the candidate pool. Furthermore, to ensure the effective transformation of sensitive information in long sequences, we also introduce the XLNet model. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of CDEA and XLNet significantly improves the quality of generated steganographic text, particularly in terms of perceptual-imperceptibility.</details>|[2505.00977v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00977v2)|null|",

However, effective cross-cultural communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and effective model compared to traditional pipelines.</details>|[2505.04639v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04639v1)|null|",

To effectively accommodate various potential downstream tasks at the receiver side, one should adaptively convey the most critical semantic information. This work presents a novel task-adaptive semantic communication framework based on diffusion models that is capable of dynamically adjusting the semantic message delivery according to various downstream tasks. Specifically, we initialize the transmission of a deep-compressed general semantic representation from the transmitter to enable diffusion-based coarse data reconstruction at the receiver. The receiver identifies the task-specific demands and generates textual prompts as feedback. Integrated with the attention mechanism, the transmitter updates the semantic transmission with more details to better align with the objectives of the intended receivers. Our test results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in adaptively preserving critical task-relevant information for semantic communications while preserving high compression efficiency.</details>|[2505.07980v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07980v1)|null|",

DCoLT treats each intermediate step in the reverse diffusion process as a latent \"thinking\" action and optimizes the entire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on the correctness of the final answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal, linear thinking process, DCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with no strict rule on grammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of thought. We implement DCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models (DLMs). First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete diffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to maximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion steps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model -- LLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential role to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking Policy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both math and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800 GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even both. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%, +5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval.</details>|[2505.10446v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10446v2)|null|",

Diffusion-based language models have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel generation capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are often constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to combine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks, modeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete diffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the preceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered by two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible control mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed granularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language models. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive framework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on local semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a classifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which significantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient post-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the performance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables effective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.</details>|[2505.14455v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14455v1)|null|",

However, diffusion language models have long been constrained by slow inference. A core challenge is that their non-autoregressive architecture and bidirectional attention preclude the key-value cache that accelerates decoding. We address this bottleneck by proposing a KV-cache-like mechanism, delayed KV-Cache, for the denoising process of DLMs. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different tokens have distinct representation dynamics throughout the diffusion process. Accordingly, we propose a delayed and conditioned caching strategy for key and value states. We design two complementary variants to cache key and value step-by-step: (1) dKV-Cache-Decode, which provides almost lossless acceleration, and even improves performance on long sequences, suggesting that existing DLMs may under-utilise contextual information during inference. (2) dKV-Cache-Greedy, which has aggressive caching with reduced lifespan, achieving higher speed-ups with quadratic time complexity at the cost of some performance degradation. dKV-Cache, in final, achieves from 2-10x speedup in inference, largely narrowing the gap between ARs and DLMs. We evaluate our dKV-Cache on several benchmarks, delivering acceleration across general language understanding, mathematical, and code-generation benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that cache can also be used in DLMs, even in a training-free manner from current DLMs.</details>|[2505.15781v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15781v1)|**[link](https://github.com/horseee/dkv-cache)**|",

However, concerns have also arisen regarding their potential to produce Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and exhibit social biases, hindering their practical use in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, prior work has focused on employing security filters to identify and exclude toxic text, or alternatively, fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models to erase sensitive concepts. Unfortunately, existing methods struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in the sense that they can have a significant impact on the normal model output while still failing to prevent the generation of harmful content in some cases. In this paper, we propose a novel self-discovery approach to identifying a semantic direction vector in the embedding space to restrict text embedding within a safe region. Our method circumvents the need for correcting individual words within the input text and steers the entire text prompt towards a safe region in the embedding space, thereby enhancing model robustness against all possibly unsafe prompts. In addition, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for semantic direction vector initialization to reduce the impact on the model performance for other semantics. Furthermore, our method can also be integrated with existing methods to improve their social responsibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively reduce NSFW content and mitigate social bias generated by diffusion models compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.</details>|[2505.15427v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15427v1)|**[link](https://github.com/lzws/Responsible-Diffusion)**|",

To address this, we introduce the Anchored Diffusion Language Model (ADLM), a novel two-stage framework that first predicts distributions over important tokens via an anchor network, and then predicts the likelihoods of missing tokens conditioned on the anchored predictions. ADLM significantly improves test perplexity on LM1B and OpenWebText, achieving up to 25.4% gains over prior DLMs, and narrows the gap with strong AR baselines. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot generalization across seven benchmarks and surpasses AR models in MAUVE score, which marks the first time a DLM generates better human-like text than an AR model.

However, state-of-the-art diffusion models (e.g., Dream 7B, LLaDA 8B) suffer from slow inference. While they match the quality of similarly sized Autoregressive (AR) Models (e.g., Qwen2.5 7B, Llama3 8B), their iterative denoising requires multiple full-sequence forward passes, resulting in high computational costs and latency, particularly for long input prompts and long-context scenarios. Furthermore, parallel token generation introduces token incoherence problems, and current sampling heuristics suffer from significant quality drops with decreasing denoising steps. We address these limitations with two training-free techniques. First, we propose FreeCache, a Key-Value (KV) approximation caching technique that reuses stable KV projections across denoising steps, effectively reducing the computational cost of DLM inference. Second, we introduce Guided Diffusion, a training-free method that uses a lightweight pretrained autoregressive model to supervise token unmasking, dramatically reducing the total number of denoising iterations without sacrificing quality. We conduct extensive evaluations on open-source reasoning benchmarks, and our combined methods deliver up to a 34x end-to-end speedup without compromising accuracy.

This approach has shown significant advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency. Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism.

Moreover, where auto-regressive models fail outright during the Needle-In-A-Haystack task with context exceeding their pretrained length, we discover diffusion LLMs exhibit a distinct local perception phenomenon, enabling successful retrieval from recent context segments.

Despite being performant, these models lack the ability to revise existing text, which limits their usability in many practical scenarios. We look to address this, with DiffusER (Diffusion via Edit-based Reconstruction), a new edit-based generative model for text based on denoising diffusion models -- a class of models that use a Markov chain of denoising steps to incrementally generate data. DiffusER is not only a strong generative model in general, rivalling autoregressive models on several tasks spanning machine translation, summarization, and style transfer; it can also perform other varieties of generation that standard autoregressive models are not well-suited for. For instance, we demonstrate that DiffusER makes it possible for a user to condition generation on a prototype, or an incomplete sequence, and continue revising based on previous edit steps.</details>|[2210.16886v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16886v1)|null|",

Their success has been recently expanded to text generation via generating all tokens within a sequence concurrently. However, natural language exhibits a far more pronounced sequential dependency in comparison to images, and the majority of existing language models are trained with a left-to-right auto-regressive approach. To account for the inherent sequential characteristic of natural language, we introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion). AR-Diffusion ensures that the generation of tokens on the right depends on the generated ones on the left, a mechanism achieved through employing a dynamic number of denoising steps that vary based on token position. This results in tokens on the left undergoing fewer denoising steps than those on the right, thereby enabling them to generate earlier and subsequently influence the generation of tokens on the right. In a series of experiments on various text generation tasks, including text summarization, machine translation, and common sense generation, AR-Diffusion clearly demonstrated its superiority over existing diffusion language models and that it can be $100\\times\\sim600\\times$ faster when achieving comparable results.

Sparse Transformer is a popular approach to improving the efficiency of Transformers by restricting self-attention to locations specified by the predefined sparse patterns. However, leveraging sparsity may sacrifice expressiveness compared to full-attention, when important token correlations are multiple hops away. To combine advantages of both the efficiency of sparse transformer and the expressiveness of full-attention Transformer, we propose \\textit{Diffuser}, a new state-of-the-art efficient Transformer. Diffuser incorporates all token interactions within one attention layer while maintaining low computation and memory costs. The key idea is to expand the receptive field of sparse attention using Attention Diffusion, which computes multi-hop token correlations based on all paths between corresponding disconnected tokens, besides attention among neighboring tokens. Theoretically, we show the expressiveness of Diffuser as a universal sequence approximator for sequence-to-sequence modeling, and investigate its ability to approximate full-attention by analyzing the graph expander property from the spectral perspective. Experimentally, we investigate the effectiveness of Diffuser with extensive evaluations, including language modeling, image modeling, and Long Range Arena (LRA). Evaluation results show that Diffuser achieves improvements by an average of 0.94% on text classification tasks and 2.30% on LRA, with 1.67$\\times$ memory savings compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, which demonstrates superior performance of Diffuser in both expressiveness and efficiency aspects.</details>|[2210.11794v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11794v2)|**[link](https://github.com/asFeng/Diffuser)**|",

However, the discrete nature of text increases the difficulty of CDM to generate coherent and fluent texts, and also causes the incompatibility problem between CDM and advanced NLP techniques, especially the popular pre-trained language models~(PLMs). To solve it, we propose Diffusion-NAT, which introduces discrete diffusion models~(DDM) into NAR text-to-text generation and integrates BART to improve the performance. By revising the decoding process of BART and the typical settings of DDM, we unify the inference process of BART and the denoising process of DDM into the same NAR masked tokens recovering task. In this way, DDM can rely on BART to perform denoising, which can benefit from both the rich pre-learned knowledge of BART and the iterative refining paradigm of DDM. Besides, we also propose the iterative self-prompting strategy to further improve the generation quality. Experimental results on 7 datasets show that our approach can outperform competitive NAR methods, and even surpass autoregressive methods.

Such heuristics falter under parallel unmasking - they ignore pairwise interactions between tokens and cannot account for dependencies when unmasking multiple positions at once, limiting their inference time to traditional auto-regressive (AR) models. We introduce the Dilated-scheduled Unmasking Strategy (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that requires no additional training. DUS leverages a first-order Markov assumption to partition sequence positions into dilation-based groups of non-adjacent tokens, enabling independent, parallel unmasking steps that respect local context that minimizes the joint entropy of each iteration step. Unlike semi-AR block approaches (e.g., LLADA and Dream) that still invoke the denoiser per block, DUS reduces the number of denoiser calls to O(log B) per generation block - yielding substantial speedup over the O(B) run time of state-of-the-art diffusion models, where B is the block size in the semi-AR inference process. In experiments on math (GSM8K) and code completion (Humaneval, MBPP) benchmarks - domains suited to non-ordinal generation - DUS improves scores over parallel confidence-based planner, without modifying the underlying denoiser. DUS offers a lightweight, budget-aware approach to efficient, high-quality text generation, paving the way to unlock the true capabilities of MDLMs.</details>|[2506.19037v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19037v1)|null|",

The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \\textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code. Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts. For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and maintain training efficiency, we propose \\textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\\% on EvalPlus) and reduces reliance on AR bias during decoding.

DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded, multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements in detection accuracy.

Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.   Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a mean of 8.05.

Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable. Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards. Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven, diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning over the air.</details>|[2507.11515v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11515v1)| null|",

However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts, exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of harmful content in the jailbreak prompt.

Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported, redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.</details>|[2507.19081v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19081v1)| null|",

However, the practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation. While the inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses internal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given task. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce DAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive Length Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two phases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial length and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided by a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL dynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation regions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully developed. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves performance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned fixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency by achieving a higher effective token ratio. By resolving the static length constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient and capable generation.</details>|[2508.00819v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00819v1)| null|",

Current caching techniques accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant, motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to 10$\\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and effectiveness.</details>|[2508.02558v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02558v1)| null|",

These models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based language models in code generation tasks.</details>|[2508.01473v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01473v2)| null|",

We derive relational datasets from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models.

Our work here reveals a critical phenomenon, temporal oscillation, where correct answers often emerge in the middle process, but are overwritten in later denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce two complementary methods that exploit temporal consistency: 1) Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, a training-free, test-time decoding strategy that aggregates predictions across denoising steps to select the most consistent output; and 2) a post-training method termed Temporal Consistency Reinforcement, which uses Temporal Semantic Entropy (TSE), a measure of semantic stability across intermediate predictions, as a reward signal to encourage stable generations. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Using the negative TSE reward alone, we observe a remarkable average improvement of 24.7% on the Countdown dataset over an existing dLLM. Combined with the accuracy reward, we achieve absolute gains of 2.0% on GSM8K, 4.3% on MATH500, 6.6% on SVAMP, and 25.3% on Countdown, respectively.

However, most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency. Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for future research in parallel text generation.

First, we can leverage the diffusion model for last-mile repair by adding noise to a broken code snippet and resuming the diffusion process. Second, we can leverage the diffusion model to generate arbitrary amount of training data for last-mile repair tasks (that are computationally more efficient) by sampling an intermediate program (input) and the final program (output) from the diffusion process.

This can be attributed to its scalability and ease of training compared to other diffusion model paradigms for discrete data, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive generator for discrete data. Diffusion models, in general, have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising process of the MDM.

Nevertheless, our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling (PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with state-of-the-art autoregressive models.

Diffusion Large Language Model May Demand a Distinct Position**|cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.CL| <details><summary>Full Abstract</summary>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive non-autoregressive paradigm due to their unique training and inference approach. However, there is currently a lack of safety study on this novel architecture. In this paper, we present the first analysis of dLLMs' safety performance and propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to their unique generation characteristics. Specifically, we identify a critical asymmetry between the defender and attacker in terms of security. For the defender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the initial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this seems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the defender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate middle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential generation order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and diverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens. Building on this asymmetry, we introduce Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA), a novel method that directly aligns the model's middle generation with safe refusals exploiting reinforcement learning. We implement MOSA and compare its security performance against eight attack methods on two benchmarks. We also test the utility of MOSA-aligned dLLM on coding, math, and general reasoning. The results strongly prove the superiority of MOSA.</details>|[2508.12398v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12398v1)| null|",

However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type.

Post-training quantization (PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a 16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention - clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods; 2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic, making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs, which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling (TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3) Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.</details>|[2508.14090v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14090v2)| null|",

However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality.
